Louis de La Forge (1632–1666) was a French philosopher who in his Tractatus de mente humana (Traité de l'esprit de l'homme, 1664; in English, "Treatise on the Human Mind") expounded a doctrine of occasionalism. He was born in La Flèche and died in Saumur. He was a friend of Descartes, and one of the most able interpreters of Cartesianism.
