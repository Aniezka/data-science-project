Ghosha (Sanskrit: घोषा) was an ancient Vedic period Indian female philosopher and seer. From a young age she suffered from a skin ailment which had disfigured her. Ashvini Kumars cured her and restored her youthfulness, health and beauty. As a result, she got married and had a son. She was proficient in the Vedas and had even scripted two hymns in the Rigveda.
