Newman was a lifelong fan of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and wrote several articles about W. S. Gilbert and the Savoy Operas.  A series of lectures about Gilbert and Sullivan-related topics have been given in his name, in New York City, by the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York. He died in 2007 of cancer at age 59.
