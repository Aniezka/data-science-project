Arthur Isadore Fine (born November 11, 1937) is an American philosopher of science now emeritus at the University of Washington. Having studied physics, philosophy, and mathematics, Fine graduated from the University of Chicago in 1958 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics. He then, in 1960, earned a Master of Science in mathematics from the Illinois Institute of Technology with a thesis supervised by Karl Menger, Fine earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1963 under the direction of Henry Mehlberg.  Before moving to the University of Washington, Fine taught for many years at Northwestern University and, before that, at Cornell University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.  He is a past president of the American Philosophical Association and the Philosophy of Science Association and has for many years been on the editorial board of the journal Philosophy of Science, one of the leading publications in the field. In 2014, Fine was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Fine famously proposed the natural ontological attitude (NOA) as a resolution to the debates over scientific realism. This philosophy takes on a neutral stance of realist and antirealist attitudes of acceptance in the industry's best theories, and calls out mistakes across existing theories. Fine also developed one of the possible interpretations of quantum mechanics yet to be decided between and has contributed to the probabilistic understanding of Bell's theorem. In 2001, Fine gave the following re-counting of the birth of NOA and its important relationship to Bas van Fraassen's antirealism:
