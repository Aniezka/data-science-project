Melvin Miller Rader (1903 â€“ 14 June 1981) was a writer and professor of philosophy at the University of Washington and a civil rights advocate. He taught ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy.[citation needed] In the late 1940s, he was accused of being a communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and was later exonerated in 1951 by Attorney General, Smith Troy[citation needed]. Ed Guthman, a Seattle Times investigative reporter, received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting of the events. In 2009, an endowment fund was created in Rader's name at the University of Washington to fund philosophy students engaged in social justice work.
