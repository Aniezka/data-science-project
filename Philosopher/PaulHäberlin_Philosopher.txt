Paul Haeberlin (17 February 1878, in Kesswil – 29 September 1960, in Basel) was a Swiss philosopher who at different times in his career took the standpoint that either religion or theoretical knowledge was the answer to human problems. He always gave philosophy an important role, but religion was to him the only way man could understand his real position in existence. Haeberlin made contributions to characterology and psychotherapeutics, and was especially successful in treating psychopathic youth and teens. Made a full professor of philosophy, psychology and pedagogics at the University of Basel. Stegmüller,W., Hauptströmungen der Gegenwartsphilosophie, Bd I, Kapitel VIII. (1978)
