Bartholomäus Keckermann (c. 1572 – 25 August (or July) 1609) was a German writer, Calvinist theologian and philosopher. He is known for his Analytic Method. As a writer on rhetoric, he is compared to Gerhard Johann Vossius, and considered influential in Northern Europe and England. Keckermann was born in Gdańsk (Danzig), in the Kingdom of Poland, to Calvinists Georg and Gertrude Keckermann and attended the local Academic Gymnasium before moving on to the University of Wittenberg (May 1590) and the University of Leipzig (spring 1592). However following the death of Prince Christian I in 1591, Keckermann participated in the migration of Calvinist academics to the University of Heidelberg in October 1592. He received his Master of Arts degree on 27 February 1595. On 4 February[dubious  – discuss] he was appointed Professor of Hebrew there. In 1601 he returned to his home town to teach as rector (1602–1608) at the Gymnasium of Danzig. His numerous works were published towards the end of his short life, or (most of them) posthumously. Keckermann died in Danzig. He is described in Melchior Adam's works. Publications:
