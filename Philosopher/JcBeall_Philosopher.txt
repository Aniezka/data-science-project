Jc Beall is an American philosopher, formerly the Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Connecticut. As of late 2020 Beall holds the Oâ€™Neill Family Chair of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. Beall is best known in philosophy for contributions to philosophical logic (particularly non-classical logic) and to the philosophy of logic. Beall, together with Greg Restall (a Melbourne logician and philosopher), is a pioneer of a widely discussed version of logical pluralism, according to which any given natural language has not one but many relations of logical consequence. Beall is also widely known for advocating a glut-theoretic account (see: dialetheism) of deflationary truth (Spandrels of Truth (2009)). Against the standard no-gap tradition in glut theory, also known as dialetheism (a neologism coined by philosophers Richard Sylvan and Graham Priest), Beall's early and post-2013 work advocates a gluts-and-gaps account of language, advocating not only the existence of truth-value gluts but also of truth-value gaps. The adoption of both gaps and gluts distinguishes Beall from other researchers in a broadly glut-theoretic ("dialethic") framework, who usually accept only gluts.
