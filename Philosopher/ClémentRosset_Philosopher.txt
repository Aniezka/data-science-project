Clément Rosset (French: [ʁɔsɛ]; 12 October 1939 – 28 March 2018) was a French philosopher and writer. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, and the author of books on 20th-century philosophy and postmodern philosophy. Rosset was born on 12 October 1939 in Barneville-Carteret, France. He graduated from the École Normale Supérieure, and he passed the agrégation of philosophy in 1965. Rosset taught French at the Université de Montréal in Quebec, Canada for two years. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in Nice, France until his retirement in the late 1990s. The bulk of his work consists in some 30 short books, all of them brief studies or essays on various topics. Most popular is probably Le réel et son double, that deals in an original manner with the inevitably illusionistic character of representations. Arthur Schopenhauer, on whom Rosset has published a few studies, remains a constant reference throughout his works. The fight with depression introduced a more personal strain in the later writings of Clément Rosset. Rosset died on 28 March 2018 in Paris, France. In English: In French:
