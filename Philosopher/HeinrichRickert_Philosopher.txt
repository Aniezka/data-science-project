Heinrich John Rickert (German: [ˈʁɪkɐt]; 25 May 1863 – 25 July 1936) was a German philosopher, one of the leading neo-Kantians. Rickert was born in Danzig, Prussia (now Gdańsk, Poland) to the journalist and later politician Heinrich Edwin Rickert and Annette née Stoddart. He was professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg (1894–1915) and Heidelberg (1915–1932). He died in Heidelberg, Germany. He is known for his discussion of a qualitative distinction held to be made between historical and scientific facts. Contrary to philosophers like Nietzsche and Bergson, Rickert emphasized that values demand a distance from life, and that what Bergson, Dilthey or Simmel called "vital values" were not true values.[citation needed] Rickert's philosophy was an important influence on the work of sociologist Max Weber.  Weber is said to have borrowed much of his methodology, including the concept of the ideal type, from Rickert's work. Also, Martin Heidegger started out his academic career as Rickert's assistant, graduated with him and then wrote his habilitation thesis under Rickert. Charles R. Bambach writes: Rickert, with Wilhelm Windelband, led the so-called Baden school of neo-Kantians.
