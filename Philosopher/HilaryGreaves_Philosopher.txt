Hilary Greaves (born 1978) is a British philosopher, currently serving as professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford and director of the Global Priorities Institute, a research centre for effective altruism at that university supported by the Open Philanthropy Project. Greaves earned a BA in philosophy and physics from Oxford in 2003, and a PhD in philosophy from Rutgers in 2008.  Her doctoral thesis was titled Spacetime Symmetries and the CPT Theorem, and was supervised by Frank Arntzenius. She has held appointments at Merton College and Somerville College and, since 2016, has been a professor of philosophy at Oxford. Greaves' current work is on issues related to effective altruism, particularly in connection to global prioritisation. Her research interests include moral philosophy (including foundational issues in consequentialism, interpersonal aggregation, population ethics, and moral uncertainty), formal epistemology, and the philosophy of physics, particularly quantum mechanics.
