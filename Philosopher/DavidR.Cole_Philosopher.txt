David R Cole (born 1967) is an Australian researcher in the fields of literacies, globalization, critical thinking, the philosophy of education and Gilles Deleuze. He is currently employed by the University of Western Sydney as Associate Professor in Literacies, English and ESL in the Centre for Educational Research as the Globalisation theme leader. Cole studied at the University of Liverpool, Bath Spa University and the University of Warwick. He started working in Australia in teacher education at the University of Tasmania (2004-2007) and lectured at the University of Technology, Sydney (2008-2011). Cole's approach is to treat educational phenomena as a form of material analysis. In so doing, he applies concepts derived from the work of Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari to the in-depth study of educational processes that simultaneously works on the micro and macro levels. He has recently been using 'immanent materialism' in this context and been developing a new approach to educational methodology since 1996.
