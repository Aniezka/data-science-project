He graduated MA in philosophy and English literature at the University of Glasgow, before benefiting from a Snell Exhibition and taking the BA in jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, MacCormick came under the influence of Professor H. L. A. Hart, and developed an interest in legal philosophy.

In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the newly elected SNP-led Scottish Government. MacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on Law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy (1984), Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory (1978), Rhetoric and The Rule of Law (2005) and Institutions of Law (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory answers many of the Dworkinian critiques of the Hartian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two. His final book was Practical Reason in Law and Morality (2008) In 1999, MacCormick was appointed Queen's Counsel 'honoris causa', and was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2001 in recognition of services to scholarship in Law.
