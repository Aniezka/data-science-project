Gérard Granel (French: [gʁanɛl]; 1930 – 10 November 2000) was a French philosopher and translator. Born in Paris, Granel attended the lycée Louis-le-Grand and the courses of Michel Alexandre, Jean Hyppolite and, later, of Louis Althusser and Jean Beaufret. He taught in Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Aix, before being appointed professor of philosophy at the Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail, a position he held from 1972 until his death. Granel translated numerous philosophical texts into French, including work by Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, David Hume, Giambattista Vico, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Granel was an important influence on a number of French philosophers, including Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy and Bernard Stiegler.
