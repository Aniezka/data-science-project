Francisco de Toledo  (4 October 1532 in Cordoba (Castille) – 14 September 1596 in Rome) was a Spanish Jesuit priest and theologian, Biblical exegete and professor at the Roman College. He is the first Jesuit to have been made a cardinal (in 1593). After studying under Domingo de Soto, Toledo became a professor of philosophy at the University of Salamanca from 1555 to 1559. He was ordained priest at Salamanca in 1556 and two years later, in 1558, entered the Jesuit order. After a brief period of spiritual formation he was called to Rome by the Superior General, Diego Láynez, where the budding Roman College was in great need of professors. Toledo successively (and successfully) taught Philosophy (1559-1562), Scholastic and Moral Theology (1562-1569), and was prefect of studies of the fast-growing university.  In the 1570s he published a number of commentaries on Aristotle's works. He directed the work on the Clementine Vulgate, the revision of the Latin Vulgate that was published in 1598; this built on the Sistine Vulgate (the 1590 text), approved by Pope Sixtus V. He died in 1596 and was buried in the Santa Maria Maggiore. The tomb monument was created in 1598 by the Flemish sculptor Gillis van den Vliete after a design by Giacomo della Porta.
