Jenefer Robinson has published widely on topics related to philosophy of art, literature and music. In Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music and Art (Oxford University Press, 2005) she developed a new theory of emotion and its connection with the arts. In the book she claims that we not only "self-evidently make emotional responses in the presence of art works, but that some art works (...) need to be experienced emotionally if they are to be properly understood". In her edited collection Music and Meaning (Cornell University Press, 1997) she brings together ten essays on the nature of musical meaning.
