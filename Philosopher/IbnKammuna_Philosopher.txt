Sa'd ibn Mansur (Izz Al-dawla) Ibn Kammuna (Arabic: إبن كمونة سعد إبن منصور, 1215—1284, was a 13th-century  Jewish physician and philosopher. His main works include a comparative treatise of the three Abrahamic religions, which includes a well informed critical evaluation of Islam, as well as a commentaries on Ibn Sina and as-Suhrawardi. Ibn Kammuna's commentary on Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi's Talwihat, the core text of Illuminationist philosophy is deemed as one of the most thorough examination of that branch of thought. His comparative treatise on the three monotheistic religions Christianity, Judaism and Islam, titled Examination of the Three Faiths challenged the legitimacy of Islam where he reasoned that incompatibility of sharia with the principles of justice undercuts Muhammad's claims of being a perfect man and stated that people convert to Islam from ulterior motives. He goes on to regard Muhammad "unoriginal" and "imperfect". The publication of the book caused rioting in Baghdad, forcing Ibn Kammuna to flee that city in secret and was recorded by the thirteenth century historian Ibn al-Fuwati.
