Demetrius (Greek: Δημήτριος; fl. 1st century), a Cynic philosopher from Corinth, who lived in Rome during the reigns of Caligula, Nero and Vespasian (37–71 AD). Demetrius was the intimate friend of Seneca, who wrote about him often, and who describes him as the perfect man: His contempt for worldly riches is shown by his reply to Caligula who, wishing to corrupt him, offered him two hundred thousand sesterces. Demetrius replied, "If he meant to tempt me, he ought to have tried to do so by offering his entire kingdom." He was also a friend of Thrasea Paetus and was with him when Thrasea was condemned to death (66 AD).  We hear of him again in the reign of Vespasian (c. 70 AD), when, curiously, he defended Publius Egnatius Celer against the charges brought against him by Musonius Rufus.  He was exiled from Rome in 71 AD, by Vespasian, along with all other philosophers. Demetrius is sometimes identified with the Demetrius of Sunium mentioned by Lucian.  However, Demetrius was a very common name in the Roman world, and Demetrius of Sunium was probably, (but not certainly), a different, later Cynic.
