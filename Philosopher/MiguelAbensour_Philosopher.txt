Miguel Abensour (French: [abɑ̃suʁ]; 13 February 1939 – 22 April 2017) was a French philosopher specializing in political philosophy. He was emeritus professor of political philosophy at the Paris Diderot University (Jussieu) and a former president of the Collège international de philosophie. Abensour has written for the revues Textures, Libre, and Tumultes. Director of the collection Critique de la politique (published by Payot & Rivages) since 1974, he was notable in contributing to the reception of the Frankfurt School in France. In his works and numerous articles, he has sought to reconcile democracy, understood as "democracy against the state", with the idea of utopia, conceived from Emmanuel Levinas's criticism of Martin Buber's idea of interpersonal relations: the I and Thou relationship opposed to the I and It. He has also published numerous articles on Emmanuel Levinas, Claude Lefort, Saint-Just, utopian socialism (Pierre Leroux, William Morris), Blanqui, and members of the Frankfurt School. An anthology and critique of his works was published in 2006 by Sens & Tonka, Critique de la politique. Autour de Miguel Abensour, edited by Anne Kupiec and Étienne Tassin.
