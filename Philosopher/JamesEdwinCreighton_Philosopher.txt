James Edwin Creighton (April 8, 1861, Pictou, Nova Scotia â€“ October 8, 1924, Ithaca, NY), was an American philosopher who believed no system of thought can be the product of an isolated mind. He was early influenced by Kant, Bradley and Bosanquet, and later accepted some of the views of Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, without sharing all of their opinions. Creighton differentiated between what he considered as intelligible in philosophy and what is intelligible in the natural sciences. Since 1895 Creighton was Sage professor of logic and metaphysic at Cornell University. Creighton (1902) was the founding president of the American Philosophical Association. His most important essays were compiled in Studies in Speculative Philosophy (Creighton, 1925; see also Sabine, 1917).
