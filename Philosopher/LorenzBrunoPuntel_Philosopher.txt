Lorenz (Lorencino) Bruno Puntel (German: [punˈteːl]; born September 22, 1935) is a Brazilian philosopher based in Germany, who established the school of Structural-systematic philosophy. Professor emeritus at the University of Munich, Puntel has been named as one of the great contemporary philosophers, articulating his ideas from the most varied traditions. Puntel studied philosophy, theology, philology and psychology in Munich, Innsbruck, Vienna, Paris, and Rome. He graduated in philosophy in Munich (1968) and in Catholic theology (1969) in Innsbruck. He became a professor at the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Munich in 1978. He was a student of Karl Rahner and studied with Martin Heidegger, whose philosophy concerned him throughout his life. Puntel's thought tries to reconstruct the systematics of philosophy from a very unique viewpoint, which involves the elaboration of a theoretical language, abandoning the idea of a language of predicates. Puntel draws on sources ranging from G. W. Leibniz, German idealism, Heidegger's phenomenology, and even analytic philosophy. Since 1983, he has been a visiting professor at Pittsburgh, Harvard and Princeton. Retired in 2001, In 2016 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Philosophy in Munich.
