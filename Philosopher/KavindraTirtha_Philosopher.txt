Kavīndra Tīrtha (Sanskrit:कवीन्द्रतीर्थ); (c. 1333 - c.1398), was a Dvaita philosopher, saint, scholar and the seventh peetadhipathi of Madhvacharya Peetha — Uttaradi Matha from 1392-1398. Kavindra is traditionally thought to be the brother of Rajendra in his previous stage of life, and identical with Viṣṇudāsācārya, the author of the Vādaratnāvalī. The latter is said to be revered by the former.  Other scholars assert that Viṣṇudāsācārya lived from 1390-1440 .
