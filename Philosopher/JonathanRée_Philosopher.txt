Jonathan Rée (born 1948) is a British freelance historian and philosopher from Bradford. Educated at Sussex University and then at Oxford, Rée was previously a professor of philosophy at Middlesex University, but gave up a teaching career in order to "have more time to think". He has written for the New Humanist, Evening Standard, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Lingua Franca, London Review of Books, Prospect, The Independent, The Times Literary Supplement, and Rising East. He is frequently a guest in radio programmes such as Journeys In Thought and In Our Time. In the early 1990s he presented a seven-part Channel 4 TV series (produced and broadcast in the UK) Talking Liberties, which featured Rée in conversation with a number of thinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricoeur, and Edward Said. Rée was a founding member of the British journal and group Radical Philosophy.
