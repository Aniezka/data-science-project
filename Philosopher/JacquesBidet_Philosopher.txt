Jacques Bidet (French: [bidɛ]; born 1935) is a French philosopher and social theorist who is currently professor emeritus in the Philosophy Department at the Université de Paris X - Nanterre. His works are mainly devoted to the construction of a theory of modern society under the name of Meta/structural theory (théorie méta/structurelle). Modern nation-states, as elements of world system, are structured on both market and organisation, supposedly rational mediations, as co-implied class factors. The philosophical, sociological, historical, legal-political and cultural aspects of this paradigm are developed in the sense of an Altermarxism, by contrast with classical Marxism. In 1989, he founded with Jacques Texier the journal Actuel Marx (Presses Universitaires de France), and in 1995, the Congrès Marx International (Université de Paris X - Nanterre).
