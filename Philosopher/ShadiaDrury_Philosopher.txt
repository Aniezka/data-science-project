Shadia B. Drury FRSC (born 1950) is a Canadian academic and political commentator. She is a professor emerita at the University of Regina. In 2005, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Drury was born in Egypt but earned her Bachelor of Arts at Queen's University and her PhD from York University. Drury has taught Political Science and Philosophy at two western Canadian universities: first at the University of Calgary and at the University of Regina, where she holds the Canada Research Chair in Social Justice. In 2005, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Two years later, she published "Aquinas and Modernity:  The Lost Promise of Natural Law" through the Cambridge University Press. She is also a columnist for Free Inquiry magazine. Several political philosophers consider Drury's attacks on Leo Strauss and his followers to be unfounded. In his 2009 book, Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers, Peter Minowitz argues that Drury’s work is “plagued by exaggerations, misquotations, contradictions, factual errors, and defective documentation.”
