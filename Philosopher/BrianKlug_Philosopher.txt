Brian Klug (* born in London) is Honorary Fellow in Social Philosophy at Campion Hall, Oxford and an emeritus member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University. He is also an honorary fellow of the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations, University of Southampton and fellow of the College, Saint Xavier University, Chicago. He is associate editor of Patterns of Prejudice, a peer-reviewed journal examining social exclusion and stigmatization, and a founder member of the Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights, a UK-based group that addresses racism and anti-Semitism, the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, immigration, and the treatment of asylum seekers. Klug was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, which published its report in September 2006. He has criticized the concept of new antisemitism as being "confused" in his 2004 essay "The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism" published in The Nation, and in several other writings. In February 2007, he was a signatory to the declaration of Independent Jewish Voices, a new Jewish group in the UK, which criticized the Board of Deputies of British Jews for its allegedly unconditional support of Israel. He is a member of the scientific advisory council of the Islamophobia Studies Yearbook.
