Wāṣil ibn ʿAtāʾ (700–748) (Arabic: واصل بن عطاء) was an important Muslim theologian and jurist of his time, and by many accounts is considered to be the founder of the Muʿtazilite school of Kalam. Born around the year 700 in the Arabian Peninsula, he initially studied under Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, the grandson of Ali. Later he would travel to Basra in Iraq to study under Hasan of Basra (one of the Tabi‘in).  In Basra he began to develop the ideologies that would lead to the Muʿtazilite school.  These stemmed from conflicts that many scholars had in resolving theology and politics.  His main contribution to the Muʿtazilite school was in planting the seeds for the formation of its doctrine. Wasil ibn Ata died in 748 in the Arabian Peninsula.[citation needed] He married the sister of Amr ibn Ubayd.
