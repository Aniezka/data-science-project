Gernot Böhme (3 January 1937 – 20 January 2022) was a German philosopher and author, contributing to the philosophy of science, theory of time, aesthetics, ethics, and philosophical anthropology. He is the main pioneer of German ecocriticism, the study of the relationship between culture and the environment. He has been the director of the Institute for Practical Philosophy in Darmstadt, Hesse, since 2005. Despite being one of Germany's most acclaimed public intellectuals, very little of his work has so far been translated into English. Böhme was born in Dessau, Anhalt, Germany. He studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Göttingen and at the Hamburg University, and completed a PhD in 1965 at Hamburg University. As a research scientist he worked at the Max-Planck-Institute with Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. From 1977 to 2002 he was Professor of Philosophy at Technical University of Darmstadt. He died on 20 January 2022, at the age of 85. 1974 Zeit und Zahl. Vittorio Klosterman. Frankfurt am Main
