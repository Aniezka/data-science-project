(Johann) Friedrich Dannemann (1858â€“1936) was a German physicist, high school teacher and historian of science. In the judgment of George Sarton, Dannemann's four-volume Natural sciences in their development and context (1910-13) was "the first satisfactory textbook dealing with the history of science as a whole". In 1927, aged sixty-eight, Dannemann became an unsalaried professor in the history of science at the University of Bonn. Dannemann also helped Abraham Wolf with his A History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the 16th and 17th Centuries.
