Dennis Geert Bernardus Johan Dieks (born 1 June 1949, in Amsterdam)  is a Dutch physicist and philosopher of physics. In 1982 he proved the no-cloning theorem (independently discovered in the same year by William Wootters and Wojciech H. Zurek). In 1989 he proposed a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, later known as a version of the modal interpretation of quantum mechanics. He also worked on the philosophy of space and time, the logic of probabilistic reasoning, and the theory of explanation. Dieks is a professor at Utrecht University and a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2008. He is co-editor of the journal Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, an editor of the journal Foundations of Physics (Editor-in-chief C. Rovelli) and co-editor of the book series European Studies in Philosophy of Science (Springer). Dieks was also an able chess player, reaching a maximum Elo rating of 2290 in 1974 and even beating Jan Timman in a game played in 1977.
