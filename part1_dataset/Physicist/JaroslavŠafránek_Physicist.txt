Jaroslav Šafránek (May 23 1890 Pilsen – Aug 22 1957 Prague) was a Czechoslovak physicist who, in the second half of the 1930s, designed a system for the transmission of visual images by low-line mechanical television, which made the production of an authentic spatial impression of the picture, transmitted on the screen, possible. His discovery was, unfortunately, largely ignored by the Czechoslovakian community.
