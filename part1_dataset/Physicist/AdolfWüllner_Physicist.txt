Adolf Wüllner (13 June 1835, in Düsseldorf – 6 October 1908, in Aachen) was a German physicist. He studied physics at the universities of Bonn, Munich and Berlin, qualifying as a lecturer at the University of Marburg in 1858. In 1862 he became director of the vocational school in Aachen, and three years later taught classes in physics at the Poppelsdorf agricultural academy. In 1867 he was named an associate professor at the University of Bonn, and from 1869 onward, was a professor of physics at the Technical University of Aachen. In 1883–86 he served as academic rector. He is remembered for his work on the specific heat of liquids and gases, vapor tension, refractive indexes and emission spectra. He was the author of a successful textbook on experimental physics that was published over several editions:  Other noted works of his include: He was also the author of many scientific papers in the journal Annalen der Physik und Chemie.
