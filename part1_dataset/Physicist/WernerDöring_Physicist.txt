Werner Döring (2 September 1911, Berlin – 6 June 2006, Malente) was a German theoretical physicist. From 1963 until his retirement in 1977, he was an ordinary professor at the University of Hamburg. His main interest was the theory of magnetism. His textbooks on theoretical physics have influenced several generations of students. He is remembered today for the Becker–Döring theory of nucleation of liquid droplets in solids (in condensed matter physics), and for the Zel'dovich–von Neumann–Döring detonation model (in explosives engineering).
