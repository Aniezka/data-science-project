Dr. Hans Adolf Breuer (22 October 1933, in Frankfurt – 19 April, 2020, in Somerset West, South Africa) was a German physicist and author of 23 mainly scientific books. Hans Adolf Breuer was born in Frankfurt and grew up in Berlin. After finishing school with Abitur, he studied Physics in Berlin and later Frankfurt, gaining a Diplom in July 1958 (summa cum laude, Thesis: A Range-Energy-Relation for Fast Electrons). He was a scientist at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt, where he received a Dr. phil. nat. (PhD) degree in February 1962 (cum laude, Thesis: Spectrum of Photo Neutrons from Lead). Between May 1962 and April 1964, he studied medicine at the Universities of Innsbruck and Tübingen as a fellow of the Studienstiftung. From May 1964 until April 1965, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Linac in Saskatoon, Canada. In July 1966, he worked as a scientist at the Technical University Darmstadt. In 1967, he was married to Rosemarie Berg and accepted the position of assistant professor for physics at the University of Saskatchewan, where his first son was born. He was granted tenure in June 1969 but moved to Pennsylvania, US, as associate professor for physics at the then California State College, receiving tenure in 1971.In 1970, his second son was born.

In Vienna, his third son was born. In October 1981, the family emigrated to Stellenbosch, South Africa, where he accepted the position of principal scientist at the National Accelerator Center in Faure. He also lectured physics for life science students at the University of Cape Town. From January 1985 to December 1989, he was a consultant at the Medical School of the University of Cape Town, and since 1991 he has been an honorary lecturer at the Medical Faculty of the University of Cape Town.
