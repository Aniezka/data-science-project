He studied mathematics and sciences at the universities of Bonn and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1843 with the thesis Imponderabilium praesertim electricitatis theoria dynamica. At Berlin his teachers were Jakob Steiner, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. In 1845 he obtained his habilitation, and from 1847 to 1894 he was a professor of physics and mineralogy at the University of Kiel. At the university he held lectures on experimental and theoretical physics, mineralogy, physical geography and meteorology. He was the doctoral advisor of the influential German-American anthropologist Franz Boas. On four separate occasions he served as university rector (1859–61, 1863–65, 1867/68 and 1890/91). He died in Kiel, aged 79. In 1845 he was a founding member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

For a period of time he was editor of the Fortschritte der Physik.
