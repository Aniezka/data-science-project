Ewald Georg von Kleist (c. 1700–1748), also known as Ewald Jürgen von Kleist, was the inventor of the Leyden jar. A member of the von Kleist family, Ewald was born in Wicewo in Farther Pomerania. His father was district administrator Ewald Joachim von Kleist [de] (1657–1716). He studied jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig and the University of Leyden and may have started his interest in electricity at the latter university under the influence of Willem 's Gravesande. From 1722–1745 or 1747[citation needed] he was dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist [de] in Kamień Pomorski, in the Kingdom of Prussia, after which he became president of the royal court of justice in Koszalin. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. On 11 October 1745 he independently invented the Kleistian jar, which could store electricity in large quantities. He communicated this discovery to a group of Berlin scientists in late 1745, and the news was transferred in a confused form to Leyden University where it was further investigated. This became more commonly known as the Leyden jar after 's Gravesande's graduate student Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leyden.
