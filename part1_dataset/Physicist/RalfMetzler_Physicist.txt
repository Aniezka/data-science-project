Ralf Metzler (born 13 October 1968) is a physicist that focuses on nonequilibrium statistical physics and anomalous stochastic processes, with applications to biological and soft matter systems.  He currently is chair professor for theoretical physics at the University of Potsdam and is an Alexander von Humboldt Polish Honorary Research Fellow. Metzler holds a Diploma (magna cum laude) degree in physics (1994) and a PhD (summa cum laude, 1996) from the University of Ulm. He performed postdoctoral research at Tel Aviv University with Joseph Klafter and Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Mehran Kardar.  Metzler became an assistant professor at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA) in Copenhagen in 2002. He later spend a period of time in Canada, where he was appointed Canada Research Chair in Biological Physics at the University of Ottawa and he moved to the Technical University of Munich as a professor. Since 2011, he is chair professor for theoretical physics at the University of Potsdam and is an Alexander von Humboldt Polish Honorary Research Fellow.
