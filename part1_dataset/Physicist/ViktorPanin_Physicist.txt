Viktor Yevgenievich Panin (Russian: Виктор Евгеньевич Панин; 10 November 1930 – 25 September 2020) was a Soviet and Russian physicist, professor, and advisor of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was an expert in the fields of solid mechanics, plastic deformation and physical materials. He was a Foreign Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus since 1999. Under the guidance of academician Victor Panin who established and developed physical mesomechanics of materials, uniting physical materials with solid mechanics at macrolevel and with physics of plastic deformation at microlevel. Within this framework, he developed new methods of computer design materials and technologies of their production. Deep mesomechanics ideas can be successfully used in the new approach to earthquake prediction where the seismic source mesostructure appears to be an intermediate term precursor.
