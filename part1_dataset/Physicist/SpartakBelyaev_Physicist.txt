In 1962 he decided to change his lifestyle a bit; he moved to Siberia and in 1968 was elected as a full member of Russian Academy of Sciences. He worked at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. For his breakthroughs and research in physics he was awarded the Landau Gold Medal in 1998 and the Feenberg medal in 2004.
