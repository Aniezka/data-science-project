Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Nemoshkalenko was Ukrainian physicist, full member (academician) of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine (1982). Most known for the development and application of methods of computational physics in the solid state spectroscopy and, in particular, for the discovery of the phenomenon of inoxidability of simple forms of matter on the surface of the celestial bodies. Born March 26, 1933 in Stalingrad, now Volgograd. In 1956 he graduated from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. From 1956 he worked at the Institute of Metal Physics of NAS of Ukraine (since 1963 – head of department, since 1967 – Deputy Director of the Institute, since 1989 – Director). His main achievements are associated with the development of physical basis of spectroscopic methods, which allowed to obtain reliable information about the electronic structure and electronic properties of materials, and in merging the electron spectroscopy experiment with the electronic band structure calculations—the two research directions which he had founded in the Institute of Metal Physics. V.V. Nemoshkalenko is co-discoverer of the phenomenon of inoxidability of simple forms of matter on the surface of the celestial bodies. Lived in Kyiv. Died on June 25, 2002.
