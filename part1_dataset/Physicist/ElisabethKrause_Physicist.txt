Anna Elisabeth Krause is a German-American astronomer and assistant professor of physics at the University of Arizona. Krause received a physics Diplom from the University of Bonn in 2007. She worked with Peter Schneider from Bonn and Lars Hernquist from Harvard on a project entitled Mock Observations of Simulated Galaxy interactions. She completed a PhD at Caltech in 2012 under Chris Hirata. Her thesis was called Topics in Large-Scale Structure. Krause spent roughly two years each at the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford-KIPAC and Caltech-JPL as a postdoctoral fellow. In 2018, she was appointed assistant professor in physics and astronomy at the University of Arizona. She was interested in working at the University of Arizona to be part of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory collaboration. Krause is a cosmologist. She works on international collaborations including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and SPHEREx, of which she is a co-investigator. She is a scientific coordinator for the Dark Energy Survey. Krause is interested in isolating the cause of cosmic acceleration by developing an analysis framework to combine datasets at different wavelengths obtained through multiple surveys. She is known for developing bias-free algorithms to connect the latest data with theory. This is particularly important when combining datasets: while the additional information can increase accuracy, the analysis must account for the relationship between the different galactic distributions. Using a blind approach can also reduce the likelihood that the analysis will be influenced by previous findings. Her goal is to shed light on the nature of dark energy. Based on large-scale galaxy structure information, Krause tunes models to determine the initial composition of the Universe.
