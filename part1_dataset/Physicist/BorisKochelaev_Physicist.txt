Boris Ivanovich Kochelaev (Russian: Бори́с Ива́нович Кочела́ев; born April 19, 1934) is a Soviet and Russian physicist and professor. Kochelaev was born in Dirizhablestroy (now Dolgoprudny), USSR. He graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the Kazan University in 1957. From 1957 to 1960, Kochelaev was a post-graduate student of the Experimental and Theoretical Physics Department of Kazan University under the supervision of Semen Altshuler. He defended his candidate's (Ph.D.) dissertation in 1960 in Kharkov State University, and his doctor's dissertation in 1968. From 1968 until now Boris Kochelaev is a professor and from 1973 to 2000 is a chair of Kazan University's Theoretical Physics Department. He is an author of more than 150 scientific works. 33 PhD-level scientists were supervised by Kochelaev, 10 of them have obtained the Doctoral degrees and become full professors. The research interests are focused on electron spin resonance and spin dynamics in condensed matter, superconductivity, propagation of the sound in resonant media, and light scattering in solids. Major research achievements: These last theoretical investigations are best described by the Nobel Prize winner Prof. K. Alex Müller in the paper titled "The Impact of ESR (EPR) on the Understanding of the Cuprates and Their Superconductivity":
