Olinto De Pretto (26 April 1857 – 16 March 1921) was an Italian industrialist and geologist from Schio, Vicenza. There is claimed by an[additional citation(s) needed] Italian mathematician, Umberto Bartocci, that De Pretto may have been the first person to derive the energy–mass-equivalence E=mc2 for mass–energy equivalence, which was derived by Einstein as a consequence of special relativity. According to Bartocci, Einstein may have learned of de Pretto's work through his Swiss-Italian friend Michele Besso. De Pretto's paper discussed the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium and was the first to conclude that this decay was energy transformation from mass into energy. He also presented a hypothesis that the intense heat assumed to be in the center of the Earth (theory of central fire) was caused by the tremendous mass of the earth creating a massive radioactive core giving off heat and energy.[citation needed] In 1906 De Pretto was accepted as a member of Accademia dei Lincei, a scientific organization whose members included Galileo Galilei. The director of the organization, Ernesto Mancini, was also a member of The Royal Society of London, an international scientific society. Mancini submitted De Pretto's paper to the Royal Society for international recognition. It was received favorably and was listed in the Society's International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.
