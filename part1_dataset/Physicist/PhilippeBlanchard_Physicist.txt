Philippe Blanchard (born January 1942) has been a Professor of Mathematical Physics at Faculty of Physics, Bielefeld University since 1980. He is both director of the Research Center BiBoS (Bielefeld-Bonn Stochastics) and deputy managing director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (Zentrum für interdisziplinäre Forschung, ZiF) at Bielefeld University. Blanchard is also the editor of Progress in Mathematical Physics, Mathematical Physics, Analysis and Geometry, and Fundamental Theories of Physics. Among his 240 scientific publications are books such as Mathematical and Physical Aspects of Stochastic Mechanics (with P. Combe & W. Zheng, 1987), Mathematical Methods in Physics: Distributions, Hilbert Space Operators and Variational Methods (with E. Brüning, 2002), and Mathematical Analysis of Urban Spatial Networks (with D. Volchenkov, 2008). Blanchard's fields of interest comprise the application of functional analysis and probability theory (stochastic analysis, random graphs), quantum and statistical physics (percolation theory, self-organized criticality), epidemiology (disease spreading), and sociology (learning as a social process, social contagion).
