Evgenii L'vovich Feinberg (27 June 1912 – 10 December 2005) was a Soviet physicist, well known for his contributions to theoretical physics. He was a son to a physician, born in Baku, moving to Moscow in 1918 where hegraduated from Moscow State University as a theoretical physicist in 1935.He worked at Lebedev Physical Institutein Troitsk, Moscow Oblast since 1938,from where he published over hundredworks in his field.Mainly, he studied radio physics (wave propagation),statistical acoustics, the neutron, cosmic rays and particle physics.In his early years, he studied the Beta-decay of ionized atoms (1939),inelastic coherent processes (1941) and inelastic diffractionprocesses (1954). He headed the high-energy particle interaction research groups 1952–78.Was a guest professor at Nizhny Novgorod State University 1944–46 and aprofessor at his former school, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute 1946–54, at what is now theMoscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
