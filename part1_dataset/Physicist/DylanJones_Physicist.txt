Dylan Jones is a professor of physics and atmospheric scientist at the University of Toronto. Jones received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 1990, a Masters in Applied Physics from Harvard in 1994, and a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Harvard in 1998. Jones' research is focused on integrating measurements of atmospheric composition with global three-dimensional models of chemistry and transport to develop a better understanding of how pollution influences the chemical and dynamical state of the atmosphere. Jones was a researcher in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University from 1998 to 2004, whereupon he took up a faculty position in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto.[citation needed] He was promoted to full professor in 2016.
