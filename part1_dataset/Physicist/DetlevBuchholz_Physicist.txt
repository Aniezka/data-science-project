Detlev Buchholz (born 31 May 1944) is a German theoretical physicist. He investigates quantum field theory, especially in the axiomatic framework of algebraic quantum field theory. Buchholz studied physics in Hannover and Hamburg where he acquired his Diplom in 1968. After graduation, he continued his studies in Physics in Hamburg. In 1970–1971 he was at the University of Pennsylvania. After receiving his PhD in 1973 under Rudolf Haag he worked at the University of Hamburg and was in 1974–1975 at CERN. From 1975 to 1978 he worked as a research assistant in Hamburg, where he got his habilitation in 1977. In 1978–1979 he had a Max Kade grant at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1979 he was a professor in Hamburg and changed to the University of Göttingen in 1997. He retired in 2010 as professor emeritus. Buchholz made contributions to relativistic quantum physics and quantum field theory, especially in the area of algebraic quantum field theory. Using the methods of Tomita–Takesaki theory, he obtained the split property from nuclearity conditions, a strong result about the locality of the theory. His contributions include the concept of infraparticles. In 1977 Detlev Buchholz won, together with Gert Strobl, the Physics Prize of the German Physical Society (today known as Gustav-Hertz-Preis) and In 1979 the Physics Prize of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. In 1995 Buchholz received the Japanese-German Research Award of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. He has been editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Reviews in Mathematical Physics. In 2008 Buchholz was awarded the Max Planck Medal for outstanding contributions to quantum field theory.
