Władysław Natanson (1864–1937) was a Polish physicist. Natanson was head of Theoretical Physics at Kraków University from 1899 to 1935. He published a series of papers on thermodynamically irreversible processes, gaining him recognition in the rapidly growing field. He was the first to consider the distinguishability of photons in the statistical analysis of elementary processes, a precursor of the concept of quantum indistinguishability.  He discovered a quantum statistics, rediscovered 11 years later by Satyendra Nath Bose and generalized by Albert Einstein – the Bose–Einstein statistics.
