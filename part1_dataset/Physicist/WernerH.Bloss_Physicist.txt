Werner H. Bloss (1930 – 6 June 1995) was a scientist known for his work in the field of photovoltaics. He was the director of the Institute of Physical Electronics at the University of Stuttgart. Werner H. Bloss studied Physics at the University of Tübingen and the University of Stuttgart. In 1955 he took the position of a research assistant at the Institute of Gas Discharge Techniques and Photoelectronics at the University of Stuttgart. Here he came into contact with various methods of energy conversion. In his doctoral thesis he described the noble gas filled thermionic converter developed by him. In the early sixties, very successful research work on various types of thermionic converters was performed under his guidance at the above-mentioned institute. In the autumn of 1967 he took a position as Associate Professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. During his two-year stay in the United States his field of interest widened again to take in optical methods of image processing. After returning from the US he implemented this novel field of research at the institute in Stuttgart. On 1 October 1970 Dr. Bloss became the director of his institute at the University of Stuttgart. He renamed it "Institute of Physical Electronics" (IPE). Professor Bloss focused the research on three main fields: This is a short version of the most important books and publications that Professor Bloss authored or co-authored:
