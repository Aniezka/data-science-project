Janina Maultzsch is a German physicist who is the Chair of Experimental Physics at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. Her research considers the electronic and optical properties of carbon nanomaterials.  Maultzsch was an undergraduate student at the Technical University of Berlin, where she studied physics.[citation needed] She remained in Berlin for doctoral research, investigating the vibrational properties of carbon allotropes including nanotubes and graphite. Maultzsch moved to the University of Siegen, where she worked on near field microscopy.[citation needed] She returned to the Technical University of Berlin in late 2004, where she worked as a researcher in the Institute of Solid State Physics. She moved to Columbia University in 2006, working as a postdoctoral researcher with Tony Heinz. She returned to Technical University of Berlin in 2008, where she was made an assistant professor. She is interested in low-dimensional materials, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and graphene. Maultzsch contributed to the understanding of carbon nanotubes. In particular, she investigated their electronic and vibrational properties. She made use of resonant Raman spectroscopy to uncover the optical transition energies and radial mode frequencies of various metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. She showed that the optical transition energies and electronic structures depend on the chirality index of the nanotube. She revealed that electron-phonon coupling increases for smaller chiral angles. In 2010, Maultzsch was awarded an ERC Starting Grant focused on the characterisation of carbon nanomaterials. In 2015, she was promoted to full Professor for Novel Materials. In 2017, Maultzsch was appointed the Chair of Experimental Physics at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg.
