Grew up in central Moscow's Arbat District, where he attended local high school No. 59. In 1954 graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology with a degree in Aeromechanics. While still an undergraduate he began his collaboration with TsAGI (Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute in Zhukovsky) where he conducted research on experimental and theoretical thermodynamics of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles until 1958. In 1958, following an invitation by academician Georgy Petrov, Ryzhov joins the Keldysh Research Centre (at the time known as NII-1); here his work focused on high speed aerodynamics. In 1961-1992 and since 1999 he has worked at the Moscow Aviation Institute: docent, professor, pro-rector, rector (1986-1992), head of the aerodynamics department since 2003. 1960-1990: Member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 1987-1990: Deputy of the Moscow City Council, also known as Mossovet. 1989-1992: Deputy of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. 1989-1991: Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Committee for Science and Technology.

Was on the inaugural board of the Moskovskiye Novosti Newspaper. Yuri Ryzhov's main works are in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, rarefied-gas dynamics, interaction of atomic scale particles with surfaces, non-equilibrium processes in gas flows, non-stationary heat transfer. In 2014 he was among the 31 signatories of a declaration, dedicated to the September 21st Peace March, demanding "to end the aggressive reckless venture: to withdraw Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine and to stop providing propaganda, material and military support to the separatists in the South-East of Ukraine".
