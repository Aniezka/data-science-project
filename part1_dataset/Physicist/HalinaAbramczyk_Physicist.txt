Halina Abramczyk (23 August 1951 in Zduńska Wola (Karsznice)) is a Polish physicist and chemist, a specialist in molecular spectroscopy and laser spectroscopy professor employed at the Lodz University of Technology. She is the daughter of Edward Chachuła (1917–1985) and Salomea Kryszak (1923–1989). She studied in 1969–1974 at the University of Łódź, where she earned a master's degree in physics and received a doctorate in 1982 at the Lodz University of Technology for work "Molecular Dynamics in two-component solutions containing benzene "(supervisor prof. Władyslaw Reimschüssel). After obtaining her doctorate in chemistry she continued scientific research in the Institute of Applied Radiation Chemistry of Technical University of Lodz, headed by prof. Jerzy Kroh. In 1985–1986 she worked as a postdoc at Bielefeld University, Germany (prof. Th. Dorfmüller). In 1989, she received her Habilitation at the Lodz University of Technology for her work "Mechanisms of vibrational relaxation in the H-bonded complexes and in conformationally mobile molecules in liquid solutions." Assistant Professor Lodz University of Technology since 1982, professor of Lodz University of Technology since 1994, extraordinary Professor since 1999, full (ordinary) professor since 2004. Founder and director of Laboratory of Laser Molecular Spectroscopy since 1992, professor and head of the Marie Curie Chair in Berlin at the Max Born Institute in 2007–2009, organizer of the European Virtual University on Lasers. She conducts research on diagnostic methods to detect early cancerous changes by Raman microscopy, Raman molecular imaging and femtosecond laser spectroscopy. Visiting professor at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain (1989), Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, Germany (1992), the University of Arizona, Tucson, USA (2002–2003), Max Born Institute, Berlin, Germany (2007–2009), the University of Nairobi, Kenya (2009–2010). She is a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Molecular Liquids since 1992. She is a board member of the European Molecular Liquids Group since 1992. Member of the Scientific Committees of many international conferences. She gave many plenary and invited lectures in Poland and abroad. She received a Fulbright Award and is a President of the Polish Fulbright Alumni Association since 2013. She is the author or co-author of many papers in the field of molecular spectroscopy, laser spectroscopy and biomedical diagnostics . She is an author of the book Introduction to Laser Spectroscopy (Elsevier, 2005) and 'Wstęp do spektroskopii laserowej' (PWN, 2000). She is an author of the book Does Africa sing a song about me? (Polygraph, 2014). Her husband, Andrew Abramczyk, is a chemical engineer; son Victor (b. 1978) after studying economics (finance and banking) at SGH (Warsaw School of Economics) settled in Warsaw.
