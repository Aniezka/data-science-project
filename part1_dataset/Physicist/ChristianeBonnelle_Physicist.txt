Christiane Bonnelle (French pronunciation: [kʁistjan bɔnɛl] (listen), died 21 August 2016) was a French physicist and pioneering spectroscopist, who served as professor emeritus at Pierre and Marie Curie University. Bonnelle studied at the Sorbonne, from which she received Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Science degrees. After completing her degree, Bonnelle worked at CNRS in 1955, where she worked as an intern and then researcher. In 1960 she started working as an assistant professor at the Sorbonne, becoming a professor in 1967. She moved to Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1974, where she became director of the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry in 1979. Bonnelle worked in this role until 1990. Bonnelle's research on solid-solid interfaces produced developments in the measurement of the nanometre, which facilitated developments in electron probes produced by CAMECA. In 1967 she received a CNRS bronze medal. She is also a chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques.
