Ardeshir "Adi" Ratan Bulsara (born 15 May 1951) is a scientist in the area nonlinear dynamics. The 2007 International Conference on Applied Nonlinear Dynamics (ICAND), held in Kauai, Hawaii, was a festschrift held in his honor of his 55th birthday. In 2004, Bulsara was elected to Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) for "developing the statistical mechanics of noisy nonlinear dynamical oscillators especially in the theory, application and technology of stochastic resonance detectors." His festschrift in honor of his 55th birthday, which, for logistic reasons, was held when he was 56.[citation needed]
