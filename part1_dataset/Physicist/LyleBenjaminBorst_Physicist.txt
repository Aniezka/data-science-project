Lyle Benjamin Borst (24 November 1912 – 30 July 2002) was an American nuclear physicist and inventor. He worked with Enrico Fermi in Chicago, was involved with the Manhattan District Project, and worked with Ernest O. Wollan to conduct neutron scattering and neutron diffraction studies. Lyle Benjamin Borst was born on 24 November 1912 in Cook County at Chicago, Illinois the son of George William Borst aged 39 of Chicago, Illinois and Jennie Beveridge aged 26. Borst was married to Ruth Barbara Mayer Borst for 63 years and had 3 children, sons, John Benjamin and Stephen Lyle and daughter, Frances Elizabeth Wright including 7 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren. He died at his home in Williamsville, New York on 30 July 2002. Borst attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and received bachelor's and master's degrees. He attended the University of Chicago and was awarded a doctorate degree in chemistry in 1941.Borst worked as a senior physicist on the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1946 at the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In 1944 Ernest O. Wollan and Borst used neutron diffraction to produce "rocking curves" for crystals of gypsum and sodium chloride (salt). In 1946 Karl Z. Morgan and Borst at Oak Ridge develop a film badge to measure worker exposure to fast neutrons. From 1946 to 1951 Borst was Chairman of the Department of Reactor Science and Engineering at Brookhaven National Laboratory and was responsible for the operation and oversight of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. He played a key role in the design of the research reactor. Borst was at the University of Utah from 1951 to 1953 as Professor of Physics. From 1956 to 1961 he was Chairman of the Department of Physics at the College of Engineering at New York University. From 1961 to 1983 Borst was Professor of Physics at State University of New York in Buffalo, New York and was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1983. In 1969 he served as Master of Clifford Furnas College at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
