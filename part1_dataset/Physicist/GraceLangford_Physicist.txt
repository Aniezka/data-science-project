She attended Wellesley College, where she was an instructor and undergraduate student simultaneously, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she earned her B.S. in physics in 1900, as the only woman in her graduating class. Her senior thesis was titled "An Investigation of the Effect of Dilution on the Color of Copper Solution and its Relation to the Dissociation Theory." From 1894 to 1905, Langford taught physics at Wellesley. In 1905, she began research at Barnard College, where she also taught. She briefly returned to Wellesley to teach in 1908, then remained at Barnard for several years. She published her research in Physical Review.
