Gisela Anton (born Gisela Glasmachers, 27 March 1955 in Bullay) is a German experimental particle and astroparticle physicist. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 1994. Since 1995, she is a professor and Chair of Experimental Physics at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg. Anton began studying physics in at the University of Bonn in 1973. In 1975, she entered and won the Bundessieger Jugend forscht (National Youth Research Competition). After earning her Ph.D. in 1983, she worked at the Physics Institute at the University of Bonn from 1984 to 1995, but also engaged in research work in Saclay (1990–1991) and Mainz (1991–1992). In 1993, she habilitated at the University of Bonn. Since 1995, she is Chair of Experimental Physics at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg. Anton's career has included working in the field of high-energy physics and the ELSA Particle Accelerator in Bonn and designing the Amadeus detector. For this work, she was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize (1994) and the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) (1995). She studied baryon resonances by real photons. In 2005, Anton explored acoustic sensors for the ANTARES neutrino telescope. Her research focuses on neutrino experiments such as ANTARES/KM3net, IceCube, and EXO-200. She is also doing applied research in the medical field on the Medipix detectors. Anton is the founder of the Erlangen Center for Astroparticle Physics (ECAP).[verification needed] She is also working with the ErlangerSchülerForschungsZentrum für Bayern (ESFZ), the Erlangen Student Research Center for Bavaria.[failed verification] In 2005, Anton delivered the Emmy Noether Lecture at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg. Gisela met her husband Frank Anton at the Bundessieger Jugend forscht (National Youth Research Competition) in 1975 and was later married in 1979.
