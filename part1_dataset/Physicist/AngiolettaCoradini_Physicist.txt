Angioletta Coradini (1 July 1946 – 4 September 2011) was an Italian astrophysicist and planetary scientist. In 1970 she completed a master's degree in physics at the University of Rome, the city where she would do her research over her entire career—at first at the university, then from 1975 at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), and finally at the National Astrophysics Institute of Italy (INAF). The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper instrument project for the Juno orbiter for Jupiter was started by Professor Angioletta Coradini. Coradini died in 2011 from cancer.
