Wolfgang Eisenmenger (11 February 1930 â€“ 10 December 2016) was a German physicist. His PhD thesis (1958) dealt with the surface tension of water and aqueous solutions. In 1964 he defended his habilitation thesis concerning experimental investigations regarding shock waves in liquids in the acoustical frequency domain. He developed from these investigations an electromagnetic shock wave generator for lithotripsy of kidney stones.
