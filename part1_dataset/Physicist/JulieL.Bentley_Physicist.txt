She is a Fellow of the Optical Society of America and the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Bentley earned her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at the University of Rochester. Her doctoral research investigated the design and manufacture of gradient-index optical systems. After her PhD, Bentley moved to the Hughes Aircraft Company, where she spent two years designing optical systems for the defence industry.Bentley is an educator, researcher and optical design consultant. She started her career at Cornel Tropel, where she designed optical assemblies. Her experience at Corning motivated her to start her own consulting company. She joined the The Institute of Optics at Rochester in 2009. At Rochester, Bentley has developed optical education for both undergraduates and professionals. She has created programs on lens design, aberrations and optical design. Bentley's research has investigated medical imaging techniques, in particular, the development of open source microscopy systems.
