Nathalie Picqué is a French physicist working at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics  in the field Frequency Combs, where she studies ultra-high resolution spectroscopy using ultrashort pulses of light combined with Fourier-transform spectroscopy to reveal the fine chemistry of samples, in particular in the mid-infrared, demonstrating resolving power in excess of 1,000,000,000,000. Nathalie Picqué received a master's degree in laser physics from Paris-Sorbonne University (formerly known as Pierre and Marie Curie University) and Ecole Polytechnique, in Paris, France and completed a doctoral  degree  in  physics from Paris-Saclay University (formerly known as Université Paris-Sud), in Orsay, France in 1998. In 2000 she was awarded the Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship to work at the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy in Florence, Italy. In 2001, she became a staff scientist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Orsay, France.[citation needed] She joined Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in 2008 as a part-time visiting scientist, before relocating her laboratory in Garching while becoming the leader of the research group. She is now a scientist in the Emeritus Group Laser Spectroscopy at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in, Germany, where she works together with Nobel prize laureate Theodor W. Hänsch on dual-combs spectroscopy.
