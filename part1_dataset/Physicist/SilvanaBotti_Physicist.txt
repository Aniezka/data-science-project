Silvana Botti is a full professor for Physics at the University of Jena. She is an expert in the development of first-principles methods for electronic excitations and methods for theoretical spectroscopy. She did her PhD at the University of Pavia in 2002. After her PhD, she was a Marie-Curie Fellow at the University of Paris-Saclay. She was also appointed CNRS Research Scientist there in 2004. In 2008, she moved to University of Lyon where she habilitated in 2010. Since 2014, she is a full professor for physics at the University of Jena. Her research group is a member of the  European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility. Her research focuses on theoretical spectroscopy and the development of first-principles methods for electronic excitations based on (time-dependent) density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. She edited the book "First Principles Approaches to Spectroscopic Properties of Complex Materials". She is an associate editor of npj Computational Materials. Her research on a silicon-based direct bandgap light emitter was announced to be the "Breakthrough of the Year" by Physics World.[clarification needed]
