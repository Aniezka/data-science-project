Gerhard Klimeck is a German-American scientist and author in the field of nanotechnology. He is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. As the director of nanoHUB, he conducts the technical developments and strategies of nanoHUB, which annually serves million users worldwide with online simulations, tutorials, and seminars. Klimeck received his Ph.D. in 1994 from Purdue University where he studied electron transport through quantum dots, resonant tunneling diodes and 2-D electron gases. His German electrical engineering degree (Dipl.-Ing.) in 1990 from Ruhr University Bochum was concerned with the study of laser noise propagation. Klimeck's research interest is in the modeling of nanoelectronic devices, parallel cluster computing, genetic algorithms, and parallel image processing. He has been driving the development of the Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool NEMO since 1994. Klimeck  was the Technical Group Supervisor of the High Performance Computing Group and a Principal Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Previously, he was a member of technical staff at the Central Research Lab of Texas Instruments where he served as manager and principal architect of the Nanoelectronic Modeling (NEMO 1-D) program. At NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Purdue University, Klimeck developed the Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO 3-D) for multi-million atom simulations.
