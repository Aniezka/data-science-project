Yakov Naumovich Feld (March 10, 1912, Kyiv — August 28, 1995, Moscow) — Soviet physicist who worked in the field of electrical engineering and antennas; laureate of A.S. Popov prize of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1986), doctor of technical Sciences (1947), Professor (1948). After graduating from a vocational school in 1927, Feld went on to complete his studies at the radio faculty of the Kyiv College of Communications in 1931. In 1932 - 1941 he worked as a consultant at the Central Radio Laboratory (CRL) in Leningrad (today's St. Petersburg) under the guidance of Professor V.V. Tatarinov. In 1939 Feld wrote a PhD thesis on "The General Theory of certain Types of Feeder Systems". As Feld did not have Bachelor or Master diploma at the time, he required a special permission of the All-Union Committee on Higher Education of the Union of People's Commissioners of the USSR allowing him to obtain a PhD. In 1941 Feld along with other employees of the Central Radio Laboratory (that had been transformed into "Factory 327") were evacuated to Krasnoyarsk. There he worked until 1946 in  what is today a scientific-industrial enterprise "Radiosvyaz". In 1946 Feld joined the laboratory of the academician Nikolai Papaleksi at the Academy of Sciences at the Institute of Physics of the USSR (FIAN). Feld completed a doctorate course and an internship with the academician M. A. Leontovich. In 1947 Feld wrote his doctoral thesis on "The Fundamentals of the Theory of Slit Antennas" and was consequently awarded the title of Professor in 1948. In February 1946 Feld was invited by M. A. Leontovich to join the Central Science and Research Institute -108 (now the Central Research Radio-engineering Institute A. I. Berg). In 1949 to 1976 Feld headed Antennas department at that institute. Throughout his life Feld combined research activities with teaching:  Feld died on August 28, 1995 in Moscow and was buried at the Preobrazhenskoe Jewish cemetery in St. Petersburg. Feld was author of 3 monographs and over 200 scientific papers, the founder of a scientific school in the field of electrical engineering, closely worked with over 40 PhD graduates and 10 doctorate PhD graduates. Feld was the founder and leader of the All-Moscow Seminar on "Diffraction and Wave Propagation" (that took place at the Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 2002 that Seminar was renamed into the Moscow Feld's Seminar of Electrodynamics. In 1956-1995 Feld was a member of the Editorial Board of a scientific journal "Radio-engineering and Electronics" of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Feld left an extensive scientific legacy:  Feld led the development of original designs of antennas with elliptical polarization, the surface wave antennas, waveguide slot and lens antennas, antennas with electrical swing beam, the axially symmetric broadband phased arrays.
