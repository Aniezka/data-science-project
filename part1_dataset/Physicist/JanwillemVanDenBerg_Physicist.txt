Janwillem van den Berg (26 November 1920 in Akkrum â€“ 18 October 1985 in Groningen) was a Dutch speech scientist and medical physicist who played a major role in establishing the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory of voice production. The most notable aspect of van den Berg's theory is its impact on modern speech science in providing a foundation for modern models of vocal fold function. Van den Berg designed the first implantable pacemaker that could be switched to a higher beat rate for a higher level of activity.[citation needed] The first experiments for an R-top triggered pacemaker were done, and the design of electrodes to the heart was tested in animal experiments. This made Van den Berg known to the cardiologists of that time.
