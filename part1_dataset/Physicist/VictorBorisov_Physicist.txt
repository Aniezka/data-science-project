Victor Vasil'evich Borisov (Russian: Виктор Васильевич Борисов) (31 October 1937 – 5 December 2013) was a Russian physicist and mathematician who contributed to the theory of wave motion, in particular to time domain electromagnetics and localized waves. Under his guidance, Vladimir Smirnov's approach to solving the initial-boundary value problem to the hyperbolic partial differential equations (in particular, the wave equation) was developed into the spacetime triangle diagram (STTD) technique. Victor Borisov's findings and ideas are summarized in two monographs edited by Leningrad State University.
