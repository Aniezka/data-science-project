Wolfgang P. Schleich (born 23 February 1957, in MÃ¼hldorf am Inn, Germany) is professor of theoretical physics and director of the quantum physics department at the University of Ulm. From 1980 to 1984, Wolfgang Schleich performed work on his diploma thesis and his Ph.D. with Marlan O. Scully at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, with an intermediate research visit at the Institute of Modern Optics, Albuquerque, from 1982 to 1983. After completion of his Ph.D., he performed post-doctorate research with John Archibald Wheeler at the Center for Theoretical Physics in Austin, Texas, USA. From 1986 to 1991, he worked as research scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching under Herbert Walther. In 1991, Schleich was nominated professor of theoretical physics at the University of Ulm. He is editor of the journal Optics Communications. He is author of several books, including Quantum Optics in Phase Space and Elements of quantum information. His areas of research include the foundations of quantum physics, as well as quantum mechanics in relation to general relativity and to number theory. His recent work includes elaborations on the role of the Wigner function in terms of quantum optics.
