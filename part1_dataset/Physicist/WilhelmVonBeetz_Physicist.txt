Wilhelm von Beetz (27 March 1822 – 22 January 1886) was a German physicist, known for his studies of electrical conductivity properties. Von Beetz was born in Berlin. He studied physics, chemistry and physiology in the University of Berlin, and after completion of studies, remained in Berlin as an instructor of physics at the Cadet Corps, followed by duties as a teacher at the artillery and engineering school. Afterwards, he was a professor at the universities of Bern (from 1856) and Erlangen (from 1858).
