Thomas W. Baumgarte (born 1966) is a German physicist specializing in the numerical simulation of compact objects in general relativity. Baumgarte completed his BSc in 1992 at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and his PhD in 1995 also at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He worked as a postdoc at Cornell University and University of Illinois and  is currently a professor of physics at Bowdoin College.  He is the author of over 65 articles about general relativity and astrophysics (for example, black holes, neutron stars, and gravitational collapse). In 2010, along with Stuart L. Shapiro, he published a book on numerical relativity. In 2012, he received the Bessel Prize. Baumgarte is married to Karen Topp, who is also a professor at Bowdoin College.
