Karl Lintner (1917 – 11 February 2015) was an Austrian nuclear physicist. During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club; he did research on the inelastic dispersion of fast neutrons in uranium. After the war, he taught and did nuclear research at the University of Vienna. He was a full member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. From 1936 to 1940, Lintner studied physics at the Universität Wien. He received his doctorate in 1940, under Georg Stetter. From 1941, Lintner was a teaching assistant to Georg Stetter at the Universität Wien. During World War II, Lintner worked on a team headed by Georg Stetter, a principal working on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club). Stetter led a group of six physicists and physical chemists in measuring atomic constants and neutron cross sections, as well as investigating transuranic elements; in 1943, Stetter held the unified directorship of the Institut für Neutronenforschung (Institute for Neutron Research), the II. Physikalische Institut and the Institut für Neutronenforschung (Institute for Neutron Research). Lintner did research on the inelastic dispersion of fast neutrons in uranium. From 1945, Lintner was an assistant at the II. Physikalische Institut der Wiener Universität (Second Physics Institute of the University of Vienna), under Eduard Haschek, Karl Przibram, and Erich Schmid.  From 1949, he was a Privatdozent at the University. Around 1959, he was a titular ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) there, and later an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor). He was a full member of the Section for Mathematics and the Natural Sciences of the Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften The following are cited as Geheimberichte (secret reports) on German nuclear research from the period 1939 to 1945 and which are being held in the Stadtarchiv Haigerloch:
