Elisa Molinari is an Italian physicist from the University of Modena and CNR, Italy. She has been primarily interested in computational materials science and nanotechnologies, and she has been particularly active in the theory of fundamental properties of low-dimensional structures, in the simulation of nanodevices, in the development of related computational methods. She also has a continuing interest in scientific imaging and communication. Since 2001, she has been a full professor of Condensed Matter Physics at Unimore, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and since 2015, she serves as Director, MaX European Centre of Excellence on 'Materials design at the exascale.' Molinari was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after she was nominated by a Forum on International Physics in 1999, for "her contribution to the theory of semiconductors and their interfaces, in particular, her fundamental work on electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction in nanostructures; and for her involvement in the training of young theorists from many countries and the organization of international conferences." Molinari has published more than 270 papers.
