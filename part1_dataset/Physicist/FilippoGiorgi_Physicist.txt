Giorgi was born in Sulmona, Italy. He got his bachelor's degree of science along with his master's from the University of L'Aquila in 1982 and four years later received his Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology. From February to September 1982 he worked as research fellow at the IBM Scientific Center in Rome, Italy. From January 1983 to August 1984 he worked at his alma mater as a research assistant and had the same position at National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado from same month of 1984 to June 1986.
