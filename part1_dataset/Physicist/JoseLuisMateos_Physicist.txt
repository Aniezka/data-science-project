Jose Luis Mateos Trigos  (born 13 July 1961) is a theoretical physicist working at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), doing research on Complex Systems, Network Science and Statistical Physics. Born in Mexico City, Mateos obtained his PhD in Physics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico UNAM in Mexico City, with a thesis on earthquakes and seismic waves, in particular the seismic response of the Valley of Mexico during the earthquakes of September 1985. Then, he went to Boston, Massachusetts, to have a postdoctoral stay as a Visiting Professor at the Physics Department of Northeastern University. There he started to work on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos. Back in Mexico City, in the Department of Complex Systems of the Institute of Physics UNAM, he continued his research on interdisciplinary and statistical physics and non linear dynamics: more specifically on transport on nonlinear chaotic systems with or without noise (ratchets) and Brownian motors. Later on, he started to work on anomalous diffusion and Lévy flights in physics and biology. More recently, he has been interested in Network Science, doing research on Lévy random walks on networks. Jose Luis Mateos has made many media appearances both in radio and TV, and host a radio show, together with Luis Manuel Guerra, on Radio Red 1110 AM.
