From 1985 to 1990 he was senior scientist at ILL and investigated the role of neutrons in particle physics and cosmology. 1991 followed a professorship at the Technical University of Munich. In 1993 he became full professor for experimental physics at Heidelberg University. From 1998 to 2001 Dirk Dubbers was the director of ILL, from 2001 to 2003 the dean of The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy in Heidelberg, and emeritus since 2011.
