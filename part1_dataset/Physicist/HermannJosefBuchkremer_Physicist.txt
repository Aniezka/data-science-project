Hermann Josef Buchkremer (11 May 1940) is a German physicist and former Rector of the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences. After completing school, Hermann Josef Buchkremer studied physics at the University of Cologne and the RWTH Aachen. After receiving his Diplom, he worked as a research associate at the Highway Research Institute of the RWTH Aachen, then at the Institute for Reactor Safety at the Jülich Research Centre. After the founding of the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences with Jülich Campus, Buchkremer started as a lecturer in physical engineering, neutron physics and atomic physics and was appointed professor several years later. Starting in 1974 he also taught the general education subjects.  In 1968 Buchkremer was elected Speaker for the Campus Jülich. In 1991 he was elected Rector of the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, where he remained until his retirement in 2005. One of Buchkremer's greatest achievements at the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences was the establishment of the Freshman Institute, which as the foundation year Studienkolleg for international students is a technical and linguistic bridge between school in the home country and study in Germany, and therefore, an optimal entry to studying in Germany . Buchkremer was appointed Honorary Senator of the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences in 2010 for his contributions to the university.
