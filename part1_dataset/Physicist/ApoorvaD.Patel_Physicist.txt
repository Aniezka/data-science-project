Apoorva D. Patel is a professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. He is notable for his work on quantum algorithms, and the application of information theory concepts to understand the structure of genetic languages. His major field of work has been the theory of quantum chromodynamics, where he has used lattice gauge theory techniques to investigate spectral properties, phase transitions, and matrix elements. He obtained his MSc in physics (1980) from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, and PhD in physics from the California Institute of Technology  under Geoffrey C. Fox (1984), with a thesis entitled: Monte Carlo Renormalisation Group for Lattice QCD. Prof. Richard Feynman was on his PhD thesis evaluation committee. The picture displayed above is from his graduation day at California Institute of Technology. He was a Scientific Associate, Theory Division, CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, 1987â€“1989,and then in 1989 he joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, as a faculty member. In 1989, he married Rashmi, a surgeon specializing in laparoscopy and endosurgery. His son, Aavishkar, was born in 1990.
