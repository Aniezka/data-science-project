Antal I. "Tony" Jákli (born 3 October 1958) is a Hungarian-American physicist and professor of Chemical Physics at Kent State University. He is known for his work with bent-core, flexoelectric, and ferroelectric liquid crystals. Jákli received a Master of Science in 1983 and later a Ph.D. in 1986 in Physics from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary. After postdoctoral fellowships with Alfred Saupe at Kent State University from 1989 to 1992 and at the Max Planck Institute in Halle, Germany, from 1993 to 1995, he became a research fellow at the Research Institute for Solid State Physics in Budapest. He was later awarded a D.Sc. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2000. He moved to the United States in 1999 to join the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University as a research fellow. He became an assistant professor there in 2004, receiving tenure in 2007 and a promotion to full professorship in 2012. His current research interests include studies of bent-core and other liquid crystals with reduced symmetry, electrospun responsive fibers and mats, flexoelectricity and piezoelectricity, small-scale rheometry, blue phases, and surface interactions of liquid crystals.
