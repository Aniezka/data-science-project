Beate Heinemann is a German particle physicist who has held positions at universities in Europe and the USA. She currently holds a joint appointment at two German institutions, Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg and the DESY laboratory in Hamburg. Born in Germany, Beate Heinemann studied for her undergraduate degree (1996) and PhD (1999) in Physics at the University of Hamburg in Germany. She became an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006. Heinemann worked on the H1 (particle detector) experiment at DESY, Hamburg, before starting work in the international  CDF collaboration at the Tevatron (a particle accelerator at Fermilab, Batavia, USA, which was shut down in 2011). She became a member of the ATLAS collaboration in 2007 at CERN, where she has been researching to secure a deeper understanding of the fundamental particles of the standard model. The research has progressed with confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. Beate Heinemann and her colleagues at CERN also strive to understand at a very fundamental level, how the universe works, what matter is made of, how matter dominated antimatter at the early hours of the universe. She has published several hundred articles in peer reviewed scientific journals. In 2013 she was elected as deputy spokesperson of the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN. She served until 2017 and has been quoted in the media.
