Mario Kopić (born 13 March 1965) is a philosopher, author and translator. His main areas of interest include: the history of ideas, the philosophy of art, the philosophy of culture, phenomenology and the philosophy of religion. Kopić is influenced by and writes extensively on Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, Reiner Schürmann and Dušan Pirjevec. He also translated works by Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, On the Genealogy of Morality), Giorgio Agamben, Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas and Dušan Pirjevec into Croatian. Mario Kopić was born in Dubrovnik, Croatia, former Yugoslavia. He studied philosophy and comparative literature at the University of Zagreb; phenomenology and anthropology at the University of Ljubljana; the history of ideas at the Institute Friedrich Meinecke at the Free University of Berlin (under the mentorship of Ernst Nolte); and comparative religion and anthropology of religion at the Sapienza University of Rome (under the mentorship of Ida Magli). Mario Kopić's philosophical work is under the influence of the Italian philosophical approach known as pensiero debole or "weak thought", the political thought of Arendt, and the ethical-political thought of late Derrida. In his latest works The Unhealable Wound of the World, The Challenges of the Post-metaphysics, Sextant and The Beats of the Other Kopić developed a kind of onto-politics of liberal-conservative postmodernism and the post-anthropocentric humanism. For him the world is the space of being as event, and only then the arena of national and social or political conflict. The world, or existence, is our ontological responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility. Kopić appears in Igor Ivanov Izi's 1995 film N.E.P.
