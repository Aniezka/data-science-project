Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren (15 November 1890, Gothenburg – 20 October 1978, Lund) was a Swedish Lutheran theologian. He was professor of systematic theology at Lund University from 1924 and was elected Bishop of Lund in 1948 (emeritus 1958). He is best known for his two-volume work Agape and Eros (first published as Eros and Agape in Swedish 1930–1936). Nygren's approach, along with that of Gustaf Aulén, characterises what is referred to as “Lundensian Theology”. Nygren's observations about love are discussed at length in M. C. D'Arcy's The Mind And Heart Of Love: Lion And Unicorn, A Study In Eros And Agape, Faber and Faber, 1945.
