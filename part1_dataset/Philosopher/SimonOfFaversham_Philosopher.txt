Simon of Faversham (also Simon Favershamensis, Simon de Faverisham, Simon von Faversham, or Simon Anglicus; c. 1260â€“1306) was an English medieval scholastic philosopher and later a university chancellor. Simon of Faversham was born in Faversham, Kent,  and educated at Oxford, receiving a Master of Arts degree. He probably taught in Paris during the 1280s. His philosophical work consists almost entirely of commentaries on Aristotle's works.[citation needed]  He was made Chancellor of Oxford University in January 1304 until his death in 1306.
