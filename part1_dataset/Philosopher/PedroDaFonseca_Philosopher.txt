Pedro da Fonseca (Latin, Petrus Fonsecae; Proença-a-Nova, 1528 – Lisbon, 4 November 1599) was a Portuguese Jesuit philosopher and theologian. His work on logic and metaphysics made him known in his time as the Portuguese Aristotle; he projected the 'Cursus Conimbricenses' realized by Manuel Góis and others.
