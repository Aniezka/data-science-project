Victor Goldschmidt (1914 – 25 September 1981) was a French philosopher and historian of philosophy. Born in Germany, he came to France in 1933. Before the war he studied at the Sorbonne and at the École pratique des hautes études under Henri Marguerite. Goldschmidt "made his name with the publication of his thesis, Les Dialogues de Platon, in 1947", for which Martial Gueroult was among the members of his examining committee. He taught at the University of Rennes from 1956 to 1966, then at Clermont-Ferrand from 1966 to 1976 and finally in Amiens until his death. The manuscript of Goldschmidt's book on Aristotle's views of time was delivered to the editor on the eve of his death. A volume was published in his memory as Histoire et Structure (1985). Though Goldschmidt is often considered a disciple of Martial Gueroult, Jacques Brunschwig has reconsidered their relationship, noting that the second edition of Godschmidt's thesis acknowledged a general debt to the "rigor" of Émile Bréhier rather than Gueroult.
