James H. Moor is the Daniel P. Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy at Dartmouth College.  He earned his Ph.D. in 1972 from Indiana University.  Moor's 1985 paper entitled "What is Computer Ethics?" established him as one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of computer ethics.  He has also written extensively on the Turing Test. His research includes study in philosophy of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and logic. Moor was the editor-in-chief of Minds and Machines (2001-2010), a peer-reviewed academic journal covering artificial intelligence, philosophy, and cognitive science. Moor lists four kinds of robots in relation to ethics. A machine can be more than one type of agent. He has criticised Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics saying that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results. He gives the example of a robot roaming the world trying to prevent harm from all humans. Source:
