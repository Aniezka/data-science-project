An expert in moral psychology, Hieronymi has written widely on issues about responsibility and agency, as well as on reasons, trust, forgiveness, and the voluntariness of belief. The work has been influential and widely cited. Hieronymi served as an advisor on moral philosophy and ethics for the popular NBC sitcom The Good Place, and subsequently became a "consulting philosopher" for the show; "surely a first in sitcom history."

In the final episode, she appeared as a cameo alongside political philosopher Todd May.
