In discussing the nature and usefulness of said tool, Pereda's work covers a very broad spectrum of disciplines that includes epistemology, political science, ethics and literature. His book Argumentative Vertigos: An Ethics of Dispute [Vértigos argumentales: una ética de la disputa] (1994) offers an original contribution to the theory of argumentation.
