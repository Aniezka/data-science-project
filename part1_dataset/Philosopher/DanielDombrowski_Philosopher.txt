Daniel A. Dombrowski (born 1953) is an American philosopher and professor emeritus of philosophy at Seattle University. He was the president of the Metaphysical Society of America (2018â€“19). Dombrowski has authored twenty books and over 170 articles in scholarly journals in philosophy, theology, classics, and literature. Among his books are Rethinking the Ontological Argument: A Neoclassical Theistic Perspective (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) and Contemporary Athletics and Ancient Greek Ideals (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009). His main areas of intellectual interest are history of philosophy, philosophy of religion (from a neoclassical or process perspective), political philosopher John Rawls, Christian ethics and pacifism. He is the editor of the journal Process Studies. Dombrowski is considered an expert on the philosophy of Charles Hartshorne. In 2016, he was described as "the most important and prolific Hartshornean today". Dombrowski has authored several books dealing with the topics of animal rights and vegetarianism, including The Philosophy of Vegetarianism, published in 1984. It documents the arguments for vegetarianism from Pythagoras through the Hellenistic period to the modern debates on vegetarianism. It was positively reviewed as an "extremely well documented work". Dombrowski's Babies and Beasts: The Argument from Marginal Cases, published in 1997 is the first book-length examination of the range of views relating to the argument from marginal cases. The book cites the arguments of Peter Singer, Tom Regan, H. J. McCloskey, Jan Narveson, John Rawls, R. G. Frey, Peter Carruthers, Michael P. T. Leahy, Robert Nozick, and James Rachels.
