Rachel Albeck-Gidron (Hebrew: רחל אַלבֶּק-גדרוֹן; born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative literature, philosophy and art. In her book, The Century of the Monads, Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between monadic metaphysics and the basic assumptions of modernistic thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the stream-of-consciousness novel. She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'. Albeck-Gidron examines the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question, in a part of a sociological discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'. She has also analyzed the work of Yoel Hoffmann in the light of western and eastern poetics. Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at Bar Ilan University in Israel.In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at Stanford University and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann". Albeck-Gidron studied realistic painting with painter Israel Hershberg at the Jerusalem Studio School in Jerusalem.
