Anilionytė is the author of a highly controversial novel about the relationship between high culture and popular culture O kas po to? (And what then?). The novel is characterized by a mix of eroticism, philosophical ponderings on the human condition  and psychological insight, social criticism and cold descriptions of moral failures. The prototype of this novel is a famous Lithuanian pop singer, Edmundas Kučinskas. Anilionytė is outstanding among other Lithuanian writers for her ironic, provocative writing style. She has been awarded some important literature prizes. She received the 2006 Cosmopolitan magazine "Discovery of the Year" award for the novel. She has translated many works by well-known German philosophers into Lithuanian. She was awarded the Franz Dovydaitis Prize in 2005.
