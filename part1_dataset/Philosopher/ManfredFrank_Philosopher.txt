Manfred Frank (born March 22, 1945) is a German philosopher, emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Tübingen. His work focuses on German idealism, romanticism, and the concepts of subjectivity and self-consciousness.  His 950-page study of German romanticism, Unendliche Annäherung, has been described as "the most comprehensive and thoroughgoing study of early German romanticism" and "surely one of the most important books from the post-War period on the history of German philosophy."   He has also written at length on analytic philosophy and recent French philosophy. Frank was born in Elberfeld, Germany, and studied philosophy at the University of Heidelberg under teachers such as Hans-Georg Gadamer, Karl Löwith, Ernst Tugendhat, and Dieter Henrich. After teaching at the University of Düsseldorf from 1971 to 1982, and at the University of Geneva from 1982 to 1987, Frank accepted a position at Tübingen in 1987.  He is a specialist in the philosophy of literature. He is the author of a wide range of books published in German, French, and English, including:
