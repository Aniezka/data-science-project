Sandra D. Mitchell (born 1951) is an American philosopher of science and historian of ideas.  She holds the position of distinguished professor in the department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, the top rated school in the world for the subject according to the 2011 Philosophical Gourmet Report.  Her research focuses on the philosophy of biology and the philosophy of social science, and connections between the two. Sandra D. Mitchell worked at the Ohio State University (1985–1989) and University of California, San Diego (1989–1999), before joining the Department of History and Philosophy of Science in 2000. She has been a fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, at the University of Bielefeld (1991–1992), the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne (2004–2005),  the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (1993–1994), and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2010). Mitchell received a B.A. in philosophy from Pitzer College (1973), a M.Sc. in Logic, Philosophy and Scientific Method from the London School of Economics (1975), and a Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Pittsburgh (1987). In her more recent articles, she has argued that the search for a unified, reductionist Theory of Everything is futile. Instead, she suggests that the sciences  focus on studying the complex correlations between elements and their emergent effects (self-organization) that, as she argues, a strictly reductionist approach is not able to adequately address.
