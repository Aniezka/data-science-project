William of Soissons; French: Guillaume de Soissons; was a French logician who lived in Paris in the 12th century. He belonged to a school of logicians, called the Parvipontians. William of Soissons seems to have been the first one to answer the question, "Why is a contradiction not accepted in logic reasoning?" by the Principle of explosion. Exposing a contradiction was already in the ancient days of Plato a way of showing that some reasoning was wrong, but there was no explicit argument as to why contradictions were incorrect. William of Soissons gave a proof in which he showed that from a contradiction any assertion can be inferred as true. In example from:  It is raining (P) and  it is not raining (¬P)   you may infer   that there are trees on the moon (or whatever else)(E). In symbolic language: P & ¬P → E. If a contradiction makes anything true then it makes it impossible to say anything meaningful: whatever you say, its contradiction is also true. William's contemporaries compared his proof with a siege engine (12th century). Clarence Irving Lewis formalized this proof as follows: Proof V    : or&    : and→    : inferenceP    : proposition¬ P  : denial of PP &¬ P : contradiction.E      : any possible assertion (Explosion). In the 15th century this proof was rejected by a school in Cologne. They didn't accept step (6). In 19th-century classical logic, the Principle of Explosion was widely accepted as self-evident, e.g. by logicians like George Boole and Gottlob Frege, though the formalization of the Soissons proof by Lewis provided additional grounding for the Principle of Explosion.
