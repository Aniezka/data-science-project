Jude was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Edward Timothy Dougherty and Cecelia Anastasia Loew. His sister was Inez Juanita Bowling. While a student at Catholic University, Jude met Patricia Ann Regan, who was studying nursing. On December 28, 1957, Jude and Patricia were married at St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Hoopeston, Illinois, and were married 62 years before Patricia's death on December 8, 2020. Together, they had four sons and ten grandchildren. He died on March 6, 2021, in Potomac, Maryland. A Mass of Christian Burial took place on March 15, 2021, at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The sermon was held by Msgr. Robert Sokolowski. In 1954, Jude earned his Bachelor's degree from Catholic University, followed by a Master of Arts in 1955. He was subsequently an instructor at Marquette University, as well as Bellarmine College. In 1960, Jude received his Doctor of Philosophy from Catholic University in Washington, D.C. Dougherty was an Assistant and Associate Professor at Bellarmine College from 1960 to 1966.

In December 1971, Jude became Editor-in-Chief of The Review of Metaphysics, a position he held for 44 years. Over 900 articles were published during his tenure, one of the longest-running editorships of a prestigious journal in history. Dougherty's acquaintance and subsequent friendship with Polish prelate Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, a fellow philosopher, led to an invitation for the Cardinal to lecture at Catholic University in July 1976. Cardinal Wojtyła would become Pope John Paul II (and later Saint) in 1978, and visited Catholic University again in 1979. Dougherty's published works include The Logic of Religion; The Good Life and its Pursuit; The Nature of Scientific Explanation; Wretched Aristotle: Using the Past to Rescue the Future; Western Creed, Western Identity: Essays in Legal and Social Philosophy; Jacques Maritain: An Intellectual Profile; Briefly Considered; Interpretations; Approaches to Morality; The Impact of Vatican II; The Theological Directions of the Ecumenical Movement; Recent American Naturalism: An Exposition and Critique; and Religion - Gesellschaft - Demokratie: Ausgewählte Aufsätze.
