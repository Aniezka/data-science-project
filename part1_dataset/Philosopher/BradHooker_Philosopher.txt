Derek Parfit, for example, wrote: "This book seems to me the best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories." Hooker initially studied philosophy at Princeton University before pursuing his BPhil and DPhil at the University of Oxford from 1981 to 1986, where he was a member of St Anne's College, and was taught and supervised by Parfit, James Griffin, and Richard Hare.
