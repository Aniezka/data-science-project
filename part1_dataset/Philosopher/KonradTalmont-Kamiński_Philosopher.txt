He publishes in journals such as The Monist, Frontiers in Psychology and Religion, Brain and Behavior, and Skeptical Inquirer magazine. During his scholarship at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research in Vienna, Austria he began working on the cognitive basis of supernatural beliefs (superstitions, magic, and religion). The work resulted in a book published in 2014 Religion as a Magical Ideology: How the Supernatural Reflects Rationality, for which he received his habilitation in 2014. He also presents his works in many conferences in Australia and Europe. He will be a speaker at the 17th European Skeptics Congress in Wrocław, Poland, where he will give a speech: Cognition and the Science/Religion Debate. His current interests are the empirical implications of the model proposed in the book, connecting ritualised behaviour with superstition, and the development of a broadly Peircean account of reason.
