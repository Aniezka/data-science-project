Edward Jonathan Lowe (/loʊ/; 24 March 1950 – 5 January 2014), usually cited as E. J. Lowe but known personally as Jonathan Lowe, was a British philosopher and academic. He was Professor of Philosophy at Durham University. Lowe was born in Dover, England. His secondary education was at Bushey Grammar School, and he subsequently studied at the University of Cambridge, 1968–72 (BA in History, 1st Class), and the University of Oxford, 1972–75 (BPhil and DPhil in Philosophy). Lowe was one of the leading philosophers of his generation. He mainly researched and published in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the history of early modern philosophy. He supervised many PhD students, working on a wide variety of topics. One of his contributions was a sophisticated defense of dualistic interactionism in the philosophy of mind. This is the view that the mind and the brain are distinct substances, and that facts about each are "causally relevant" to the other. He also published over 200 articles, including in the leading journals in the field, such as The Journal of Philosophy, Mind, and Noûs.
