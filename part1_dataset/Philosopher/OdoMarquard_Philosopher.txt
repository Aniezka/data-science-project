Odo Marquard (26 February 1928 – 9 May 2015) was a German philosopher and academic. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Giessen from 1965 to 1993. In 1984 he received the Sigmund Freud Prize for Scientific Prose. Odo Marquard was born in Stolp, Farther Pomerania. He studied philosophy, German literature, and theology, obtaining his doctorate at the University of Münster and his habilitation at the University of Freiburg. In Münster he studied under Joachim Ritter, whose Ritter School he sometimes is considered a member of. An even greater influence was Max Müller, whom Marquard studied under in Freiburg, and his use of the philosophy of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger to create a phenomenological update of neo-scholasticism. From 1965 to 1993, Marquard held a chair for philosophy at the University of Giessen, serving as dean of the philosophical faculty. In 1982–1983 he was a fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. From 1985 to 1987 he was the president of the General Society for Philosophy in Germany. In 1984 he was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize for Scientific Prose by the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung. He was awarded the Erwin-Stein-Preis (1992), the Ernst-Robert-Curtius-Preis for essay writers (1996), the Hessian Cultural Prize for science (1997), the Hessian Order of Merit (1990) and two Orders of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany: the Cross of Merit 1. Class (1995) and the Great Cross of Merit (2008). In 1994, the year after he became Professor Emeritus at Giessen, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena. A proponent of philosophical hermeneutics and skepticism, Marquard’s work focuses on aspects of human fallibility, contingency, and finitude. He rejected idealist, rationalist, and universalist conceptions, and defended philosophical particularism and pluralism. His essay "In Praise of Polytheism" provoked discussion and controversy in Germany. In it, he promotes a "disenchanted return of polytheism" as a political theology. Criticized by Jürgen Habermas as a representative of German neoconservatism, his philosophy has been described as a form of liberal conservatism with various parallels to postmodern thought and the work of Richard Rorty.
