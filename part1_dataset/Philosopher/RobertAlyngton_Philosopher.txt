Robert Alyngton (a.k.a. Arlyngton; died September 1398), was an English philosopher who developed new logical, semantic, metaphysical, and ontological theories in 14th century thought.  Alyngton is credited with creating the ideological foundation for the Oxford Realists by substituting reference to objective reality with reference to mental and linguistic reality. Alyngton was a Fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford from 1379 until 1386. He was deeply influenced by the metaphysics of John Wyclif who began his theological studies at Queen's College in 1363.  Alyngton was Chancellor of Oxford University in 1394â€“5. He later became Rector of Long Whatton, Leicestershire, until his death 1398.
