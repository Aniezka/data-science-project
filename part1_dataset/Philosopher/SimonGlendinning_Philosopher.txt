Simon Glendinning (born 1964) is an English philosopher. Glendinning is Professor of European Philosophy and Head of department in the European Institute at the London School of Economics. Glendinning studied philosophy at the University of Oxford and at the University of York, since which he has held a series of positions:[citation needed] Glendinning's work is characterised by the way in which it engages with thinkers and themes from both the 'analytic' and 'continental' traditions in philosophy.[citation needed] His first book, On Being With Others: Heidegger-Wittgenstein-Derrida, is an analysis of the problem of other minds. His later writings are largely concerned with the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. In the Name of Phenomenology is a detailed study of that tradition. The Idea of Continental Philosophy is a critique of the contemporary division between ‘analytic’ and ‘continental’ philosophy, and argues that phenomenological philosophy, in particular, should not be conceived as an exclusively ‘continental’ tradition. In 2011 he published Derrida: A Very Short Introduction. However, most of his work since 2007 has involved a turn from European Philosophy towards the Philosophy of Europe. In 2021 he published a two-volume study in the Philosophy of Europe, entitled Europe: A Philosophical History. In January 2015, Glendinning was a guest on BBC Radio 4's In Our Time, which discussed phenomenology. His father was the Goya specialist, Nigel Glendinning. His mother is the author, Victoria Glendinning. He is the youngest of four brothers. The eldest, Paul Glendinning, is a mathematician at the University of Manchester. The second is the photographer, Hugo Glendinning and the third is a sports journalist, Matthew Glendinning. He lives in Oxford in Oxfordshire with his wife, the writer Anjali Joseph. Glendinning has authored and edited the following books:
