Purana Kassapa (IAST: Pūrṇa Kāśyapa; Pali: Pūraṇa Kassapa) was an Indian ascetic teacher who lived around the 6th century BCE, contemporaneous with Mahavira and the Buddha. Purana taught a theory of "non-action" (Pāli, Skt.: akiriyāvāda) whereby the body acts independent of the soul, merit or demerit.  In the Pali Canon, Purana (along with the ascetic Makkhali Gosala) is identified as an ahetuvadin, "denier of a cause" (of merit). As an example of Purana's beliefs, in the Samannaphala Sutta (DN 2) it is reported that Purana said: The Anguttara Nikaya also reports that Purana claimed to be omniscient.  The Dhammapada commentary claims that Purana died by drowning himself.
