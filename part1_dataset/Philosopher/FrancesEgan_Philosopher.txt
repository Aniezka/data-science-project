Her work focuses on the nature of psychological explanation, and on the relationship between folk explanation and scientific explanation.  She is known for her work on the role of representational content in computer models of mind. She argues that computational models of mind do not require meaning ascriptions, and that meaning ascriptions should be viewed as helping to connect the formal characterization of a computational theory with our intuitive belief that mental processes are intentional. She has also written on vision, including the history of vision. Egan has received a number of awards including research fellowships at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Center for Interdisciplinary Research, Bielefeld, Germany. She is the recipient of the 2021 Jean Nicod Prize.
