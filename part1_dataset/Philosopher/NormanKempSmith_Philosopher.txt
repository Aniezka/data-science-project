Norman Duncan Kemp Smith, FBA, FRSE (5 May 1872 – 3 September 1958) was a Scottish philosopher who was Professor of Psychology (1906–1914) and Philosophy (1914–1919) at Princeton University and was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh (1919–1945). He is noted for his 1929 English translation of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, which is often considered the standard version. He was born Norman Smith on 5 May 1872 in Dundee, Scotland, the son of a cabinet-maker on the Nethergate. He was educated in Dundee and then studied mental philosophy at the University of St Andrews, graduating with an MA with first-class honours in 1893. He received his doctorate (PhD) in 1902. He lectured in philosophy and psychology at Princeton University from 1906 to 1916, and at the University of Edinburgh from 1919 until his retirement in 1945. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1921. His proposers were Ralph Allan Sampson, Thomas James Jehu, Charles Glover Barkla and Charles Sarolea. In 1932 he delivered the Adamson Lecture of the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1938 he moved to 14 Kilgraston Road in south Edinburgh, a house designed by Sir Robert Matthew. His translation of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is often used as the standard English version of the text. His commentaries on the Critique are also well regarded, as are his works on David Hume and other philosophers. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1947 to 1948. A portrait by the Edinburgh artist Adam Bruce Thomson is held by the University of Edinburgh's Fine Art Collection. Kemp Smith died on 3 September 1958 in Edinburgh. In 1910 he married Amy Kemp (d.1936), and thereafter became known as Norman Kemp Smith. The Kemp Smith Room in the University of Edinburgh's Philosophy Department is named in his honour.
