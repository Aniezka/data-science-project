Frederick Pond Ferré (March 23, 1933 – March 22, 2013) was Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at The University of Georgia. He was a past president of the Metaphysical Society of America. Much of his work concerned how metaphysics is entwined with practical questions about how we live our life, including the ethical dimensions of life. His most notable contribution to scholarship was a defense of Christian metaphysics in response to the charge of people like G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell that Christian claims are linguistically meaningless and should be rejected as such. Ferre argued that Christian metaphysics was legitimate because it passed a fourfold test of a metaphysical worldview, being consistent, coherent, applicable, and adequate.
