Bob Hale, FRSE (1945 â€“ 12 December 2017) was a British philosopher, known for his contributions to the development of the neo-Fregean (neo-logicist) philosophy of mathematics in collaboration with Crispin Wright, and for his works in modality and philosophy of language. Hale obtained a BPhil in Philosophy in 1967 from Linacre College, University of Oxford. From 2006 until his death, he was a professor of philosophy in the department of philosophy at the University of Sheffield. Prior to that, he taught in the University of Glasgow, the University of St. Andrews and the University of Lancaster. Hale produced the first published neo-Fregean construction of the real numbers. In his book (Necessary Beings), he argues for an essentialist theory of necessity and possibility.
