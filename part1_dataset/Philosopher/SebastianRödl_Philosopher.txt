Sebastian Rödl (born 1967) is a German philosopher and professor of practical philosophy at the University of Leipzig. From 2005 to 2012 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Basel. Rödl studied philosophy, musicology, German literature and history in Frankfurt am Main and Berlin, completing his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of Albrecht Wellmer. His work focuses on the self-conscious nature of human thought and action. His main influence is Hegel, and he sees himself as introducing and restating Hegel's Absolute Idealism in a historical moment that is wrought with misgivings about the merits and even the mere possibility of such a philosophy.
