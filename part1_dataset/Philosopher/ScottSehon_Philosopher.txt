Scott Robert Sehon (born 1963) is an American philosopher and the Joseph E. Merrill Professor of philosophy at Bowdoin College. His primary work is in the fields of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of action, and the free will debate. He is the author of Teleological Realism: Mind, Agency and Explanation (MIT University Press, 2005) in which he takes a controversial, non-causalist view of action explanation as well as Free Will and Action Explanation: a Non-Causal, Compatibilist Account (Oxford University Press, 2016). Sehon has also published in the area of philosophy of religion, with a particular focus on the problem of evil and whether or not religious faith is a necessary foundation for morality. In his later work, he has criticized "anti anti-communism" and American conservative arguments against socialism. Sehon received his B.A. in philosophy from Harvard University, where he worked with Warren D. Goldfarb, and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy at Princeton University, where he worked with Mark Johnston and Harry Frankfurt.
