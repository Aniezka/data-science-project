David O. Brink (born 1958) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, San Diego.  He works in the areas of moral, political, and legal philosophy. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy at Cornell University where he worked with Terence Irwin and David Lyons. He taught for two years at Case Western Reserve University, and then from 1987 to 1994 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining the faculty at UCSD. Brink is associated with the view known as "Cornell Realism." Cornell realism was developed in the 1980s by the philosophers Richard Boyd and Nicholas Sturgeon, both faculty members at Cornell University. The view combines ethical realism with moral naturalism. Ethical realism holds that ethical judgments, such as "murder is wrong," are factual claims similar to "Albany is the Capital of New York" in being objectively true or objectively false. Moral naturalism holds that moral properties – such as the properties of being right, wrong, good, bad, virtuous or vicious – are natural properties that have a status comparable to other natural properties, such as those of being a tiger, being gold, or being an electron.
