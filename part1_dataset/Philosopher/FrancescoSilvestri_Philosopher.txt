Francesco Silvestri, O.P. (ca. 1474 â€“ 19 September 1528) was an Italian Dominican theologian.[note 1] He wrote a notable commentary on Thomas of Aquinas's Summa contra gentiles, and served as Master General of his order from 1525 until his death. Francesco Silvestri was born at Ferrara in about 1474. At the age of fourteen he joined the Dominican Order. In 1516 he was made a master in theology. He was prior first in his native city and then at Bologna, and in the provincial chapter held at Milan in 1519 he was chosen vicar-general of the Lombard congregation of his order. Having discharged this office for the allotted term of two years, he became regent of the college at Bologna where he remained for a considerable time. He was also inquisitor of Bologna from 1519 until 1525. Later he was appointed by Pope Clement VII vicar-general of his entire order, and on 3 June 1525, in the General Chapter held at Rome, he was elected Master General. As general of his order he visited nearly all the convents of Italy, France, and Belgium, making efforts there to restore discipline. He was planning to begin a visitation of the Spanish convents when he died of an illness on 19 September 1528 at Rennes in Brittany. Leandro Alberti, his traveling companion, remarked that Silvestri was a man of "remarkable mental endowments," and that "nature seemed to have enriched him with all her gifts." Silvestri wrote many works on philosophy, most notably on Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle.
