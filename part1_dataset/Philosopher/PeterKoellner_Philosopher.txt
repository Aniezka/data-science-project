Peter Koellner is Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D from MIT in 2003. His main areas of research are mathematical logic, specifically set theory, and philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of physics, analytic philosophy, and philosophy of language. In 2008 Koellner was awarded a Kurt Gödel Centenary Research Prize Fellowship. Currently, Koellner serves on the American Philosophical Association's Advisory Committee to the Eastern Division Program Committee in the area of Logic. According to a review by Pierre Matet on Zentralblatt MATH, his joint paper with Hugh Woodin Incompatible Ω-Complete Theories contains an illuminating discussion of the issues involved, which makes it recommended reading for anyone interested in modern set theory.
