Alcorn's best-known invention is the X-ray spectrometer, which earned him the NASAâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center award for Inventor of the Year in 1984. Other significant inventions concerned plasma etching for semiconductor devices. In 1999, Alcorn was honored with an award from Government Executive magazine for developing the Airborne LIDAR Topographic Mapping System (ALTMS) in partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center. In 2015, Alcorn was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention of the X-ray spectrometer. Alcorn married his wife Marie DaVillier in 1969 and they have one son born in 1979.
