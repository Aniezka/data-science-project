Montserrat Calleja Gómez (born April 20, 1973) is a Spanish physicist who specializes in Bionanomechanics. She is currently a research professor at the Institute of Micro and Nanotechnology in Madrid, Spain. Montserrat was born in the Spanish Province of Ourense, Galicia, Spain. She obtained her degree in Physics from University of Santiago de Compostela in 1998. She finished her Master's Degree in 2000 with the thesis "Optimizing the AFM dynamic mode for nanolithograph". She obtained her doctoral degree from the same University in 2002, after working under the supervision of Ricardo García at the Micro and Nanoelectronics Institute of Madrid specializing in nanotechnology and biosensors. Her PhD thesis was on the “Local oxidation of silicon surfaces by Atomic Force Microscopy and nanolithography applications”. She held a postdoctoral position as a Marie Curie fellow in the Technical University of Denmark- MIC where she worked on the nanofabrication of cantilever-based sensors under the supervision of Annia Boysen. She led the NANOFORCELLS project, whose goal was to study the mechanical properties of cells and its relationship with cancer. From 2008 to 2012, she was the Head of the Devices, Sensors and Biosensors department at the Institute of Micro and Nanotechnology. One of her patented inventions is a nano-mechanical mass spectrometer to weight individual proteins of cells. She was the co-founder of Mecwins SA and Nanodreams SL.
