Johann Gottlieb Christian Nörremberg (11 August 1787, in Pustenbach – 20 July 1862) was a German physicist who worked on the polarization of light. From 1823 he taught classes in mathematics and physics at the military school in Darmstadt. In 1833 he became a professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the University of Tübingen, where he worked on surveying and the development of optical instruments. Among his better known creations was a polarization apparatus, a device used in the making of a "Nörremberg polariscope". Most of his scientific articles were published in Poggendorfs Annalen.
