Megan J. Povey is an English food physicist who is a professor at the University of Leeds. She is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and founding member of the Physics in Food Manufacturing group. Povey earned her bachelor's degree in physics at Lancaster University. As a student in the 1960s, Povey became involved with political activism, campaigning against nuclear power and being part of Unite Against Fascism. Her doctorate involved work of military potential, and she was offered several research and development positions in defence contractors. Povey was not interested in these careers; being anti-war and pro civil rights, and pursued an academic career at the University of Leeds.[citation needed] Povey joined the School of Food Science at the University of Leeds as a postdoctoral researcher in the 1970s.  There she started studying the physics of food, specialising in the application of ultrasound in both characterisation and food manufacture. She has studied the crystallisation and growth of fat. Her research combines computational and mathematical modelling to develop both food and equipment. Povey has also studied the physical processes that underpin digestion, in an attempt to develop foods that can be digested by older people. Povey has served as president of the University of Leeds University and College Union (UCU). She is a member of Scientists for Global Responsibility. Povey was born Malcolm Povey. In 2017 she transitioned to Megan.
