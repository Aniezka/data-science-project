Before joining Michigan State University, he was a professor of Applied Life Sciences at the Keck Graduate Institute in Claremont, California. Adami is best known for his work on Avida, an artificial life simulator used to study evolutionary biology, and for applying the theory of information to physical and biological systems.  Together with Nicolas J. Cerf, Adami made significant advances in the quantum theory of information in the late 1990s. He received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal while serving at JPL, and was elected a Fellow of the AAAS in 2012. He was also elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2017.
