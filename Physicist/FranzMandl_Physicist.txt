Franz Mandl (1923â€“2009) was a British theoretical physicist, known for his graduate-level textbooks. Mandl was born in Vienna in 1923 into a Jewish family. They moved to Berlin in the 1920s, and after the rise of Nazi Germany, the family emigrated to England as refugees in 1936. Mandl received a scholarship to study at Lincoln College, Oxford where he received his undergraduate and doctorate degrees in physics. After receiving his doctorate, Mandl spent a few years in the US, before returning to the UK to become a reader of physics at the University of Manchester. He spent his career there collaborating in atomic research and writing textbooks. His books were considered influential to the graduate study of theoretical physics. Mandl married Betty Clifford, a mathematician whom he met while studying at Oxford. He died in 2009 at the age of 85.
