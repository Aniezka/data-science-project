Ashok Das is an Indian-American physicist. Das was born in Puri, Odisha. He received his BS (with honors) in 1972 and MS in 1974 in physics from the University of Delhi. He did his graduate studies in supersymmetry and supergravity at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He received his Ph.D in Spin 3/2 Fields and Supergravity Theories in 1977.[citation needed] He was a research associate at the City College of New York, the University of Maryland and Rutgers University before joining the University of Rochester in 1982. He was promoted to professor in 1993 and is still working there today. He is also an adjunct professor of physics at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in India.[citation needed] Das' research is in the area of theoretical high energy physics.[citation needed] He works on supersymmetry and supergravity. In recent years, he has worked extensively on non-linear integrable systems, which are systems that, in spite of their complicated appearance, can be exactly solved.[citation needed] He has also been working on finite temperature field theories, generalization of the Standard Model to incorporate CP violation, and problems in quantum field theory and string theory.[citation needed] In 2006, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach physics in Brazil. He has written books and monographs on various disciplines of theoretical physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, like  A Path Integral Approach (World Scientific publishers), Finite Temperature Field Theory (World Scientific publishers), Integrable Models (World Scientific Lecture Notes in Physics), Lectures on Gravitation (World Scientific publishers), and Lectures on Electromagnetism. In 2002, Das was made a fellow of the American Physical Society "for contributions in the areas of supergravity, integrable models, and finite temperature field theory."
