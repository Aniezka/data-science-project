Yitzhak Maron (Hebrew: יצחק מרון) is a plasma physicist and a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science. He was known for pioneering spectroscopic techniques to measure and characterize plasmas under extreme conditions (e.g. high-current, high-voltage, high-fields, short-duration) which won him the 2007 IEEE Plasma Science and Applications (PSAC) Award and the 2009 John Dawson Award for Excellence in Plasma Physics Research. Maron obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1977. Upon graduation, he remained at the institution and worked as a postdoctoral fellow until 1980. He then moved to the Laboratory of Plasma Studies at Cornell University and became a Research Associate until 1984. Maron eventually returned to the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) as a professor in the Faculty of Physics and became head of the WIS Plasma Laboratory. Maron was inducted as a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1996 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2003.
