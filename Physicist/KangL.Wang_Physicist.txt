Kang Lung Wang is recognized as the discoverer of chiral Majorana fermions by IUPAP. Born in Lukang, Changhua, Taiwan, in 1941, Wang received his BS (1964) degree from National Cheng Kung University and his MS (1966) and PhD (1970) degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1970 to 1972 he was the Assistant Professor at MIT. From 1972 to 1979, he worked at the General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center as a physicist/engineer. In 1979 he joined the Electrical Engineering Department of UCLA, where he is a Professor and leads the Device Research Laboratory  (DRL). He served as Chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering at UCLA from 1993 to 1996. His research activities include semiconductor nano devices, and nanotechnology; self-assembly growth of quantum structures and cooperative assembly of quantum dot arrays Si-based Molecular Beam Epitaxy, quantum structures and devices; Nano-epitaxy of hetero-structures; Spintronics materials and devices; Electron spin and coherence properties of SiGe and InAs quantum structures for implementation of spin-based quantum information; microwave devices. He was the inventor of strained layer MOSFET, quantum SRAM cell, and band-aligned superlattices. He holds 45 patents and published over 700 papers. He is a passionate teacher and has mentored hundreds of students, including MS and PhD candidates. Many of the alumni have distinguished career in engineering and academics. He is a leader in Nanotechnology. He has been the Raytheon Chair Professor of Physical Science since 2006. He serves on the editorial board of the Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology TM (American Scientific publishers). He currently also serves as the Director of Marco Focus Center on Functional Engineered Nano Architectonics (FENA), an interdisciplinary Research Center, funded by Semiconductor Industry Association and Department of Defense to address the need of information processing technology beyond scaled CMOS. The Center involves 12 universities across the nation with 35 participating faculty members. He is also the Director of the Western Institute of Nanoelectronics (WIN) - a coordinated multi-project Research Institute. WIN is funded by NRI, Intel and the State of California. The current on-going projects are aimed at spintronics for low power applications.  He currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology (TNANO).  He was also the founding director of Nanoelectronics Research Facility at UCLA (established in 1989) with the infrastructure to further research in nanotechnology. In addition to these technical leadership contributions, he has provided academic leadership in engineering education. He was also the Dean of Engineering from 2000 to 2002 at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 2018: Magnetism award and Nēel Medal, International Union of Pure and Applied Physics  2018: Laureate of Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan  2018: Dr. Dan S.
