Ignazio Licata, born 1958, is an Italian theoretical physicist, professor and scientific director of the Institute for Scientific Methodology, Italy. Licata has studied with David Bohm, Jean-Pierre Vigier, Abdus Salam and Giuseppe Arcidiacono. Licata is editor-in-chief of the Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics (EJTP) and scientific director of the interdisciplinary Institute for Scientific Methodology (ISEM), located in Bagheria, Province of Palermo, Italy. He has worked on quantum field theory, interpretation of quantum mechanics, and recently quantum cosmology. His further topics of research include the foundation of quantum mechanics, space-time at Planck scale, the group approach in quantum cosmology, systems theory, non-linear dynamics, as well as computation in physical, biological and cognitive systems (logical openness, sub and super Turing systems). Licata has developed a new approach to quantum cosmology ("Archaic Universe") based on de Sitter invariant special relativity.
