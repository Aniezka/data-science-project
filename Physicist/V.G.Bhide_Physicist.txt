He was the scientific advisor to the Government of India during 1973-75 and a member of the  International Commission on the Applications of Mossbauer Effect. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992. Bhide, born in 1925 in Nagpur, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, obtained his master's degree in Physics from Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University with first rank and gold medal and secured a doctoral degree from the same university.
