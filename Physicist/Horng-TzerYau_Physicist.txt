Horng-Tzer Yau (Chinese: 姚鴻澤; pinyin: Yáo Hóngzé; born 1959 in Taiwan) is a Taiwanese-American mathematician. He received his B.Sc. in 1981 from National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. in 1987 from Princeton University. Yau joined the faculty of NYU in 1988, and became a full professor at its Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1994. He moved to Stanford in 2003, and then to Harvard University in 2005. He was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1987–88, 1991–92, and 2003, and was a distinguished visiting professor in 2013–14. According to William C. Kirby,  dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, "Professor Yau is a leader in the fields of mathematical physics,  ...  who has introduced important tools and concepts to study probability, stochastic processes, nonequilibrium statistical physics, and quantum dynamics." Yau is a 2000 MacArthur Fellow.
