Vinen was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1973. His certificate of election reads:  He was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1980 in "recognition of his discovery of the quantum of circulation in superfluid helium and his development of new techniques for precise measurements within liquid helium."
