In 1957, Bowden became Reader of Physics at Cambridge, and in 1966 became the Professor of Surface Physics. He made significant contributions to the field of tribology and he received the International Award from the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers in 1955. He was also named as one of 23 "Men of Tribology" by Duncan Dowson. Much of Bowden's tribology research was performed alongside David Tabor, with whom he published his popular book 'The Friction and Lubrication of Solids'. Bowden died on 3 September 1968. He married Tasmanian Margot Hutchison in London in 1931. They had 3 sons and a daughter.
