Anthony Schuyler Arrott (born April 1, 1928) is an American-born Canadian physicist, Professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University. He is a specialist in condensed matter physics, physics of magnetism and liquid crystals. He is the author of over 200 scientific papers. Arrott is the subject of the 2020 documentary Portrait, directed by Lily Ekimian and A.T. Ragheb. In 1957, he suggested a straightforward criterion for ferromagnetism from observations of magnetic isotherms.This method was called Arrott plots.In collaboration with Murray J. Press, he gave a description of surface singularities in liquid-crystal droplets.A lot of works are devoted to the properties of ferromagnetic samples (for example the so-called Arrott's cylinder) with micrometer and sub-micrometer sizes. Commissioned in 1978, Arrott designed the Thermal Neutron Facility at the TRIUMF cyclotron.
