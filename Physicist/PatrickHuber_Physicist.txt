Patrick Huber is a German theoretical particle physicist known for his calculation of the reactor neutrino flux, and for his work in computing sensitivity of neutrino oscillation experiments and applications of reactor neutrino detection.  He is a Professor of Physics Virginia Tech and Director of Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. In 2016 he was honored with the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for his work on the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. Huber studied at the Technical University Munich, completing his diploma in 2000 and his Doctor rerum naturalium in theoretical Physics in 2003, under the supervision of Manfred Lindner.  After completing postdoctoral appointments at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and CERN he started a faculty position in the Virginia Tech Physics Department in 2008, and received tenure in 2012.  He became director of the Center for Neutrino Physics in 2017.
