Gustav Andreas Johannes Jaumann (1863â€“1924) was an Austrian physicist. An assistant to the physicist Ernst Mach, he had a talent for mathematics, but disbelieved the existence of small particles like electrons and atoms. Between 1901 and 1924 he taught physics at the German Technical University in Brno. He won the Haitinger Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1911.
