Anatoly Alexandrovich Maslov is a Russian physicist, professor of Aerohydrodynamics Department at the Novosibirsk State Technical University, specialist in the field of laminar-turbulent transition. In 1973, Anatoly Maslov defended his Ph.D. thesis "Stability of a compressible boundary layer over a cooled surface"; in 1988, he defended his doctoral dissertation "The onset of turbulence in supersonic boundary layers". In the same year, the scientist became the head of Laboratory No.13 of Physical Problems of Control of Gas-Dynamic Flows at the Khristianovich Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Thanks to the skills of experimental work and numerical simulation in supersonic aerodynamics, as well as experience in large aerodynamic installations, he significantly intensified the scientific activity of the laboratory. On June 28, 2022, Anatoly Maslov was arrested on suspicion of state treason. He was taken by plane to Moscow and placed in the Lefortovo pre-trial detention center.  A few days later, another Novosibirsk scientist Dmitry Kolker was also arrested on suspicion of state treason.
