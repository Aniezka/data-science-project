Dipankar Banerjee is an Indian solar physicist. He is Professor of Solar Physics at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (Bangalore) and currently serves as the director of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (AIRES). In 1987, Banerjee completed a Bachelor's Degree at St. Xaviers College, Calcutta in Physics (major), Chemistry and Mathematics. In 1996 he completed his PhD "Magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in the solar atmosphere" at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (Bangalore) with Prof. S.S. Hasan. Via a PPARC fellowship, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Armagh Observatory between 1997 and 2000 on solar atmospheric dynamics using the SOHO spacecraft. This was followed by a Fund for Scientific Research (Flanders) fellowship at the Katholic University of Leuven between 2000 and 2002. In 2004, he returned to the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (Bangalore) and was promoted to Professor in 2016. Banerjee's primary research interest is the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. In particular, he has focussed on the propagation of wavs through the solar chromosphere and corona, including innovations in the technique of atmospheric magnetoseismology. He has also studied space weather and the solar dynamo through long-term observations such as those provided by the 100-year synoptic data from Kodaikanal Observatory.
