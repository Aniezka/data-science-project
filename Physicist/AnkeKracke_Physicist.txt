Kracke studied physics at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. In 2007, she began doctoral work with Klaus Blaum at MPIK. She defended her thesis, The g-factor of the valence electron bound in lithiumlike silicon 28Si11+: The most stringent test of relativistic many-electron calculations in a magnetic field, in 2013. She subsequently worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Florida State University with Edmund G. Myers. In 2012, she won the Helmholtz Prize for precision measurements together with her doctoral supervisor Klaus Blaum and Sven Sturm.
