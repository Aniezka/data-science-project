Alberto Carpinteri (born 23 December 1952) is an Italian professor and engineer. Alberto Carpinteri is professor in science of construction at the Polytechnic University of Turin and was director of the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Turin.  He is a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. He is mainly known for his contribution in the study of piezonuclear fission, which is the purported theory that "compressing solids can provoke nucleus-splitting reactions without emitting gamma-rays or producing nuclear waste". In 2013 INRiM was set in temporary receivership and Carpinteri dismissed after the resignation of two-thirds of the board of directors in objection of Carpinteri's support in the purported theory of piezonuclear fission.
