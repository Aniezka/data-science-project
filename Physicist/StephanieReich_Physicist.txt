Stephanie Reich is a German physicist and Professor at the Free University of Berlin. Her research considers the physics of nanostructures, which she studies using experimental characterisation techniques and computational simulations. Reich attended the Technical University of Berlin where she studied physics. She earned her undergraduate and master's diplomas in 1998, before embarking on a doctoral programme. After a year as a research assistant, Reich moved to the Institut de Ci√®ncia de Materials de Barcelona. In 2002 she was made a Fellow of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 2003 Reich moved to the University of Cambridge as an Oppenheimer Research Fellow. Whilst at Cambridge she held a joint position at Newnham College, Cambridge. She started to work on the characterisation of graphene, In 2007 Reich was appointed Professor of the Physics of Nanostructures at the Free University of Berlin. When she arrived at the Free University of Berlin she was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) starting grant, which was later upgraded to a Consolidator Grant. Reich focusses on one dimensional nanostructures, including graphene, semiconductor nanowires and carbon nanotubes.
