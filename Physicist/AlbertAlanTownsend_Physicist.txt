Albert Alan Townsend (22 Jan 1917 – 31 Aug 2010) was an Australian scientist specialized in fluid dynamics. He was the author of the textbook The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow (1956; 1976; Cambridge University Press). The terms Townsend's eddies(or Townsend's wall-attached eddies), Batchelor–Howells–Townsend spectrum and Townsend–Perry constants in turbulence research are named after him. His PhD advisor was G. I. Taylor and he was a close collaborator of George Batchelor. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society. Graduated from Canberra University and Melbourne University, he started his physicist career with in the field of nuclear physics. In 1938, he went to the University of Cambridge and joined the Cavendish Laboratory for a PhD degree (at that time, there were no Australian universities offering PhD degree). During the Second World War, he joined military research and worked on aerodynamics in Australia. In this period, he met George Batchelor and started to research in fluid dynamics. After getting back to Cambridge, he and Batchelor studied under Geoffrey Ingram Taylor. He obtained PhD in 1947 and the thesis title was Beta Ray Spectra of Light Elements and Turbulent Flow. Townsend remained in the Cavendish Laboratory for the rest of his career. Outside work, he married Valeria Dees(?–2002) in 1950 and they had three children. He was an enthusiastic tennis player.
