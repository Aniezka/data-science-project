In 1954 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign under Charles Slichter with thesis Magnetic Induction in Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance. Bloom was supported by an NRC Travelling Postdoctoral Fellowship at Leiden University from 1954 to 1956. At the University of British Columbia, he was a research associate in 1956–1957, an assistant professor in 1957–1960, an associate professor in 1960–1963, a full professor in 1963–1994, and professor emeritus from 1995 until his death.
