Lars Elof Gustaf Brink (born 12 November 1943 - died 29 October 2022) was a Swedish theoretical physicist. He made significant and well-cited contributions in supersymmetry, supergravity, superspace, and superstrings., and the connections among them. In 1977, with John Schwarz and Joël Scherk, he introduced  the first supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. During 1971–1973, he was member of the theory group at CERN. Starting in 1986, he had been  professor of theoretical physics at Chalmers Institute of Technology in Gothenburg. Brink is one of the pioneers of superstring theory, since the 1970s (at CERN and Caltech). He coordinated the EU network Superstring Theory 1991–1995 and 2000–2008. In 1997 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 2001, 2004 and from 2008 to 2013 he was a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics and its chairman in 2013.
