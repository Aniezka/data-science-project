Richard Kerner (born 3 January 1943) is a French theoretical physicist and[dead link]Professor Emeritus of Pierre and Marie Curie University whose research extends into gravitation, cosmology, field theory, solid-state physics, noncommutative geometry, quantum mechanics and mathematical and theoretical biology. Richard Kerner was born on January 3, 1943, in Furmanova, USSR. He obtained his baccalaureate at the Reytan High School (Liceum im. Tadeusza Reytana) in Warsaw. He then studied at the University of Warsaw from 1960 to 1965, obtaining his master's degree under the supervision of Andrzej Trautman. He continued his formation at the Pierre and Marie Curie University and defended his doctoral thesis in 1975 On certain applications of the Yang–Mills theory, with Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat and André Lichnerowicz as advisors.  Kerner began work as a professor and researcher at Pierre and Marie Curie University, working at the Laboratory of Relativistic Mechanics from 1969 to 1985 and the Laboratory of Elementary Particles from 1985 to 1990. In 1990 Kerner became the Director of the Laboratory of Relativistic Cosmology until 2001, switching positions to work at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and Condensed Matter. Kerner was an invited researcher at the University of Utrecht in 1976, the Joseph-Louis Lagrange Institute in Torino in 1981, CERN in Geneva in 1983 and 1988, the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy at the University of Florence (LENS) in 2006, and the Federal University of Espírito Santo, Vitória in 2013. Currently Kerner is the author of over 200 scientific publications, including several books on physics.
