In 2006, he was recognized for outstanding contributions to theoretical research on quantum coherence.  B.-G. Englert's principal research interests concern applications in quantum information science, but he is also known for his early work on quantum optics together with Marlan Scully at Texas A&M University. Englert was American Physical Society Outstanding Referee in 2008, and is the Scientific Secretary of the Julian Schwinger Foundation. Englert obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of TÃ¼bingen in 1981.  He did post-doctoral research at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and obtained his Dr. rer. nat. habil. in 1990. Englert is the author of more than 160 publications in the fields of atomic, molecular and optical physics. He published Symbolism of Atomic Measurements by Julian Schwinger (Springer Publishing, 2001, ISBN 978-3-540-41408-7) which is authoritative in the field of quantum mechanics.
