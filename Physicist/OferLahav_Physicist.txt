His work involves Machine Learning for Big Data.  Lahav served as the UCL Head of Astrophysics (2004–2011), Vice-Dean (Research) of UCL's Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (2011–2015), and as Vice-President of the Royal Astronomical Society (2010–2012). He is one of the founders of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and he co-chaired the international DES Science Committee from inception until 2016. He chairs both the DES:UK and DESI:UK consortia, as well as the DES Advisory Board. He previously served as a member of the STFC Science Board (2016–2019). From 2012 to 2018, Lahav held a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant on "Testing the Dark Energy Paradigm" (TESTDE programme). Lahav studied Physics at Tel-Aviv University (BSc, 1980), Physics at Ben-Gurion University (MSc, 1985) and earned his Ph.D. (1988) in Astronomy from the University of Cambridge, where he was later a Member of Staff at the Institute of Astronomy (1990–2003) and a Fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Lahav's research is focused on cosmological probes of Dark Matter and Dark Energy,in particular large galaxy surveys.Lahav has co-authored over 400 research articles in peer reviewed scientific journals, including 10 invited review articles and book chapters. Lahav is a Thomson ISI highly cited author, h-factor 83. His past doctoral students include Chris Lintott.
