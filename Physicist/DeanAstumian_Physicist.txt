Raymond Dean Astumian is an American physical chemist. Astumian earned a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1978 and 1982. He obtained a doctorate in mathematical science and physical chemistry from the same institution the next year. Astumian is a professor at the University of Maine. In 2000, he was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society "[f]or fundamental contributions to understanding the thermodynamics and mechanism of transduction of energy from a non-equilibrium chemical reaction to drive directed transport by molecular motors and pumps." Astumian won the 2011 Feynman Prize for Theory.
