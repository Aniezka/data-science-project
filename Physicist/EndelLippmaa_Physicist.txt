Lippmaa was founder and chairman of the Science Council of the National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics. He was also head chairman and professor of chemical physics, physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the Estonian Academy of Sciences and was highly regarded in his work into solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In 1999, he was voted one of the 100 great Estonians of the 20th century. In 1972, Endel Lippmaa was elected as a Member of the Estonian Academy of Sciences.

During Lippmaa's time working in physics, he wrote a paper on "Structural studies of silicates by solid-state high-resolution silicon-29 NMR,". This paper, now highly regarded, demonstrated in 1980 that high-resolution NMR spectroscopy could be applied profitably to inorganic samples, not just organic or biological ones. According to Google Scholar, the paper has garnered 969 citations. During the Singing revolution he was an active member of the Popular Front of Estonia.
