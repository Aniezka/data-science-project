Eric Glen Blackman (born September 21, 1968 in Rochester, New York) is an American astrophysicist and professor. Blackman graduated from the Harley School, and then obtained undergraduate degrees in  physics and mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked at the General Electric Research Laboratory  during undergraduate summers. He subsequently completed a Master of Advanced Study  in mathematics (applied math/theoretical physics, Part III of the Mathematical Tripos) at  Cambridge University, residing at Trinity College, Cambridge, followed by a Phd at  Harvard University working in theoretical astrophysics with George B. Field.   He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge of Cambridge University and in physics at Caltechbefore joining the Department of Physics and Astronomy faculty at the University of Rochester. Blackman has made diverse contributions to theoretical astrophysics through 250+ research publications  on topics that include stellar and planetary astrophysics, molecular clouds, planetary nebulae, accretion, jets, particle acceleration, turbulence, laboratory astrophysics, and relativistic astrophysics—including gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. He is particularly known for work in  plasma astrophysics involving magnetic fields, and principles of astrophysical dynamo theory—the latter being a theory of magnetic field origin in astrophysical objects such as galaxies, stars, accretion disks and planets.    Blackman has also worked on the mechanics and biomechanics of helmet protection against closed traumatic brain injury, identifying protection deficiencies in standard helmets for both head impacts and blast exposure.
