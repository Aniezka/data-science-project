Kurt Binder (10 February 1944 – 27 September 2022) was an Austrian theoretical physicist. He received his Ph.D. in 1969 at the Technical University of Vienna, and his habilitation degree 1973 at the Technical University of Munich. He decided to accept a professorship post for Theoretical Physics at the Saarland University, having an offer from the Freie University in Berlin as well at the same time.  From 1977 to 1983, he headed a group for Theoretical Physics in the Institute for Solid State Research at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, prior to taking his present post as a University Professor for Theoretical Physics at the University of Mainz, Germany. Since 1989 he was also an external member of the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Physics in Mainz.[citation needed] Since 1977, Binder was married to Marlies Ecker, with whom he had two sons.[citation needed] His research was in several areas of condensed matter physics and statistical physics. He was best known for pioneering the development of Monte Carlo simulations as a quantitative tool in statistical and condensed matter physics, establishing simulations as a third branch in addition to theoryand experiment, and for catalyzing its application in many areas of physical research. He made very important contributions to numerous fields, ranging from phase transitions and spin glasses to polymer physics. He is one of the most cited physicists worldwide. The eponymous Binder cumulant is a very important and frequently used quantity in analyzing phase diagrams. Binder was a member of the editorial board of several leading scientific journals as well as a member of academies of science in Austria, Bulgaria, and Germany.[citation needed]
