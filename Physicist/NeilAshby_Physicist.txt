Neil Ashby  (born March 5, 1934 in Dalhart, Texas) is an American physicist. He attended Dalhart High School, graduating in 1951. He received his B.A. degree (Summa Cum Laude) in physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 1955, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1956 and 1961, respectively. After spending a year in Europe as a postdoctoral fellow, he joined the faculty of the Department of Physics at the University of Colorado in 1962. He has been a Professor of Physics there since 1970, and was Department Chair from 1984 to 1988. He is currently Professor Emeritus - Theoretical math-physics at the University of Colorado. He consults for the Time and Frequency Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, working on relativistic effects on clocks and global time synchronization. His work was the basis of general relativistic correction being properly included in the Global Positioning System. He was a member of the International Committee on General Relativity and Gravitation from 1989 to 1995. He serves on several international working groups on relativistic effects in geodesy and in metrology.  His work has influenced areas as diverse as:
