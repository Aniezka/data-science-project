René Moreau (born in 1938 in Autun) is a French scientist and professor emeritus at the Institut national polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG). He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences. René Moreau is Professor Emeritus at Grenoble-INP, where he directed the ENSHMG from 1982 to 1987 and where he taught fluid mechanics at all levels. His research has focused on the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) of liquid metals, including turbulence that tends to become two-dimensional in the presence of a relatively strong magnetic field, as well as various applications of MHD in metallurgical processes. He has also participated in the understanding of instability phenomena in insulating liquids subjected to an electric field.  He was the founder of the MADYLAM Scientific Interest Group, for "MAgnétoDYnamique des Liquides, Applications à la Métallurgie", which became the EPM group (for Elaboration par Procédés Magnétiques) of the Laboratoire Science et Ingénierie des Matériaux et des Procédés (SIMaP). He has been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 1993 and a member of the Academy of Technology since 2000. He is the author of numerous publications, a monograph "Magnetohydrodynamics" (Springer, 1990) and a popular science book "Air and Water" (EDP sciences, 2013). He was the founding editor of the Springer Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications collection. He is now one of the editors of the Encyclopedia of the Environment, an open access website that went online in October 2016. His main contributions concern the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) of liquid metals, a field in which he has supervised more than 40 doctoral students, many of whom have now become his colleagues, in France or abroad. In this vast scientific field, he focused his attention on MHD turbulence, MHD convection, Hartmann layers, Alfven waves in liquid metals and applications in metallurgy. At the University of Grenoble, in 1978 he founded the MADYLAM laboratory (for: "MAgnétoDYnamique des Liquides. Applications to Metallurgy"), whose current name is EPM (for "Electromagnetic Processes of Materials"). He has published more than 100 articles in leading scientific journals and a book (Magnetohydrodynamics, Kluwer Acad. Pub. 1990). A list of his most recent publications is given below. He was the founder of the international association "HYDROMAG", of which he was the first President (1995-2000). He is the scientific editor of the "Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications" monograph series published by Springer, and has been editor, or associate editor, of several major scientific journals (J. de Mécanique, European J. of Mechanics: B/Fluids, CRAS). 1989, J.
