He serves as the associate editor of Advances in Space Research, and as a member of editorial board of the European journal Space Science Reviews and Molecular Astrophysics. Bhardwaj's research interests include theoretical and observational studies of planetary surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres and their coupling with magnetospheric plasma and solar wind.[citation needed] Bhardwaj was the principal investigator on various experiments on multiple space missions. These missions include the Chandrayaan-mission â€“ the first Indian Lunar Mission, the first Indian Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) and the Chandrayaan-2 mission.  Experiments include the Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) experiment, the MENCA experiment and the CHACE-2 experiment. He was principal investigator and co-investigator on many observation programs with Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope of NASA; XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory of ESA; and Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) of India).
