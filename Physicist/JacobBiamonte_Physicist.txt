Jacob Daniel Biamonte FInstP is an American physicist and theoretical computer scientist active in the fields of quantum information theory and quantum computing. He left a tenured professorship at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War.  Biamonte contributed several universality proofs which established the first experimentally relevant universal models of adiabatic quantum computation.  He also proved universality of the NISQ era variational model of quantum computation and published several results in the development of quantum machine learning and the mathematics of tensor networks. Biamonte completed a Ph.D. at the University of Oxford in 2010. In 2022 he defended a thesis for Russia's Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 2023 Biamonte was elected Fellow of the Institute of Physics and in 2021 he became a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. In 2018 Biamonte was awarded the USERN Medal in Formal Sciences for his work on quantum algorithms.  In 2014 Biamonte became an invited member of the Foundational Questions Institute.
