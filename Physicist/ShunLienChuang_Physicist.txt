Shun Lien Chuang  (Chinese: 莊順連, September 10, 1954 –  March 26, 2014) was a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer, optical engineer, and physicist. He was a Fellow of the IEEE, OSA, APS and JSPS, and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Chuang received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the National Taiwan University (1976), and M.S. (1980), E.E. (1981), and Ph.D. (1983) degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1983, he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he remained until his retirement in 2012. He is the author of a leading textbook on the physical theories for lasers and allied devices, Physics of Photonic Devices (2009).
