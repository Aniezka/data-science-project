He was the longest-serving director (1956-1971) of the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL) in Utqiaġvik, Alaska (formerly known as Barrow) where he established and managed the NARL ice stations in the Arctic Ocean.

He often credited a number of Iñupiat scientists such as Jacob Stalker, Kenneth Utuayuk Toovak, Pete Sovalik, and Harry Brower Sr., as his greatest teachers, and he relied heavily on traditional Iñupiat knowledge of the Arctic and the ice to assist NARL scientific projects. Brewer appeared before the Senate Subcommittee Hearings on Native Land Claims, Anchorage, Alaska, and gave a statement in support of protecting the Iñupiat people’s rights over their own land assets.

In 1950, he received a bachelor’s degree in geological engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. in 1956 he married an Utqiaġvik-based and Seattle-born nurse, Marylou Cunningham and became the youngest director of NARL. In 1965 he received an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Alaska for his work in the Alaskan Arctic. Brewer died in 2012 at the age of 88 and is buried in Utqiaġvik.
